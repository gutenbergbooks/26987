<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A MAIDEN&#8217;S &#8220;HUMPH&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>A Farm-hand nodded in answer to a question
asked him by Napoleon on the morning
of Waterloo. The nod was false, or the
emperor misunderstood&mdash;and Waterloo was
lost. On the nod of a farm-hand rested the
fate of Europe.</p>
<p>This story may not be so important as the
battle of Waterloo&mdash;and it may be. I think
that Napoleon was sure to lose to Wellington
sooner or later, and therefore the words &#8220;fate
of Europe&#8221; in the last paragraph should be
understood as modified by &#8220;for a while.&#8221; But
this story may change the world permanently.
We will not discuss that, if you please. What
I am endeavoring to make plain is that this
history would never have been written if a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
farmer&#8217;s daughter had not said &#8220;Humph!&#8221; to
her father&#8217;s hired man.</p>
<p>Of course she never said it as it is printed.
People never say &#8220;Humph!&#8221; in that way. She
just closed her lips tight in the manner of people
who have a great deal to say and prefer
not to say it, and&mdash;I dislike to record this of
a young lady who has been &#8220;off to school,&#8221; but
truthfulness compels&mdash;she grunted through
her little nose the ordinary &#8220;Humph!&#8221; of conversational
commerce, which was accepted at
its face value by the farm-hand as an evidence
of displeasure, disapproval, and even of contempt.
Things then began to happen as they
never would have done if the maiden hadn&#8217;t
&#8220;Humphed!&#8221; and this is a history of those happenings.</p>
<p>As I have said, it may be more important
than Waterloo. <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</i> was, and
I hope&mdash;I am just beginning, you know&mdash;to
make this a much greater book than <i>Uncle
Tom&#8217;s Cabin</i>. And it all rests on a &#8220;Humph!&#8221;
Holmes says,</p>

<p>but what bard shall rightly sing the importance
of a maiden&#8217;s &#8220;Humph!&#8221; when I shall have finished
telling what came of what Jennie Woodruff
said to Jim Irwin, her father&#8217;s hired man?</p>
<p>Jim brought from his day&#8217;s work all the fragrances
of next year&#8217;s meadows. He had been
feeding the crops. All things have opposite
poles, and the scents of the farm are no exception
to the rule. Just now, Jim Irwin possessed
in his clothes and person the olfactory pole opposite
to the new-mown hay, the fragrant butter
and the scented breath of the lowing kine&mdash;perspiration
and top-dressing.</p>
<p>He was not quite so keenly conscious of this
as was Jennie Woodruff. Had he been so, the
glimmer of her white piqué dress on the bench
under the basswood would not have drawn him
back from the gate. He had come to the house
to ask Colonel Woodruff about the farm work,
and having received instructions to take a
team and join in the road work next day, he
had gone down the walk between the beds of
four o&#8217;clocks and petunias to the lane. Turning
to latch the gate, he saw through the dusk
the white dress under the tree and drawn by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
the greatest attraction known in nature, had re-entered
the Woodruff grounds and strolled
back.</p>
<p>A brief hello betrayed old acquaintance, and
that social equality which still persists in theory
between the work people on the American
farm and the family of the employer. A desultory
murmur of voices ensued. Jim Irwin sat
down on the bench&mdash;not too close, be it observed,
to the piqué skirt.... There came
into the voices a note of deeper earnestness,
betokening something quite aside from the rippling
of the course of true love running
smoothly. In the man&#8217;s voice was a tone of
protest and pleading....</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are,&#8221; said she; &#8220;but after all
these years don&#8217;t you think you should be at
least preparing to be something more than
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;m tied
hand and foot.... I might have ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but, Jim,
you haven&#8217;t ... and I don&#8217;t see any prospects....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
&#8220;I have been writing for the farm papers,&#8221;
said Jim; &#8220;but ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere, you
know.... You&#8217;re a great deal more able and
intelligent than Ed &mdash;&mdash; and see what a fine
position he has in Chicago....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s mother, you know,&#8221; said Jim gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything here,&#8221; said Jennie.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been a farm-hand for fifteen years
... and you always will be unless you pull
yourself loose. Even a girl can make a place
for herself if she doesn&#8217;t marry and leaves the
farm. You&#8217;re twenty-eight years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all wrong!&#8221; said Jim gently. &#8220;The
farm ought to be the place for the best sort
of career&mdash;I love the soil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been teaching for only two years, and
they say I&#8217;ll be nominated for county superintendent
if I&#8217;ll take it. Of course I won&#8217;t&mdash;it
seems silly&mdash;but if it were you, now, it would
be a first step to a life that leads to something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother and I can live on my wages&mdash;and
the garden and chickens and the cow,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Jim. &#8220;After I received my teacher&#8217;s certificate,
I tried to work out some way of doing
the same thing on a country teacher&#8217;s wages.
I couldn&#8217;t. It doesn&#8217;t seem right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim rose and after pacing back and forth
sat down again, a little closer to Jennie. Jennie
moved away to the extreme end of the
bench, and the shrinking away of Jim as if he
had been repelled by some sort of negative magnetism
showed either sensitiveness or temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as if it ought to be possible,&#8221; said
Jim, &#8220;for a man to do work on the farm, or
in the rural schools, that would make him a
livelihood. If he is only a field-hand, it ought
to be possible for him to save money and buy a
farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa&#8217;s land is worth two hundred dollars an
acre,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;Six months of your wages
for an acre&mdash;even if you lived on nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he assented, &#8220;it can&#8217;t be done. And
the other thing can&#8217;t, either. There ought to
be such conditions that a teacher could make a
living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They do,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;if they can live at
home during vacations. <i>I</i> do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But a man teaching in the country ought
to be able to marry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry!&#8221; said Jennie, rather unfeelingly, I
think. &#8220;<i>You</i> marry!&#8221; Then after remaining
silent for nearly a minute, she uttered the
syllable&mdash;without the utterance of which this
narrative would not have been written. &#8220;<i>You</i>
marry! Humph!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Irwin rose from the bench tingling with
the insult he found in her tone. They had been
boy-and-girl sweethearts in the old days at the
Woodruff schoolhouse down the road, and before
the fateful time when Jennie went &#8220;off to
school&#8221; and Jim began to support his mother.
They had even kissed&mdash;and on Jim&#8217;s side,
lonely as was his life, cut off as it necessarily
was from all companionship save that of his
tiny home and his fellow-workers of the field,
the tender little love-story was the sole romance
of his life. Jennie&#8217;s &#8220;Humph!&#8221; retired
this romance from circulation, he felt. It
showed contempt for the idea of his marrying.
It relegated him to a sexless category with
other defectives, and badged him with the celibacy
of a sort of twentieth-century monk, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
the honor of the priestly vocation. From
another girl it would have been bad enough,
but from Jennie Woodruff&mdash;and especially on
that quiet summer night under the linden&mdash;it
was insupportable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said Jim&mdash;simply because he
could not trust himself to say more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; replied Jennie, and sat for a
long time wondering just how deeply she had
unintentionally wounded the feelings of her
father&#8217;s field-hand; deciding that if he was
driven from her forever, it would solve the
problem of terminating that old childish love
affair which still persisted in occupying a suite
of rooms all of its own in her memory; and
finally repenting of the unpremeditated thrust
which might easily have hurt too deeply so
sensitive a man as Jim Irwin. But girls are
not usually so made as to feel any very bitter
remorse for their male victims, and so Jennie
slept very well that night.</p>
<p>Great events, I find myself repeating, sometimes
hinge on trivial things. Considered
deeply, all those matters which we are wont to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
call great events are only the outward and visible
results of occurrences in the minds and
souls of people. Sir Walter Raleigh thought
of laying his cloak under the feet of Queen
Elizabeth as she passed over a mud-puddle, and
all the rest of his career followed, as the effect
of Sir Walter&#8217;s mental attitude. Elias Howe
thought of a machine for sewing, Eli Whitney
of a machine for ginning cotton, George Stephenson
of a tubular boiler for his locomotive engine,
and Cyrus McCormick of a sickle-bar, and
the world was changed by those thoughts,
rather than by the machines themselves. John
D. Rockefeller thought strongly that he would
be rich, and this thought, and not the Standard
Oil Company, changed the commerce and
finance of the world. As a man thinketh so
is he; and as men think so is the world. Jim
Irwin went home thinking of the &#8220;Humph!&#8221; of
Jennie Woodruff&mdash;thinking with hot waves and
cold waves running over his body, and swellings
in his throat. Such thoughts centered upon
his club foot made Lord Byron a great sardonic
poet. That club foot set him apart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
from the world of boys and tortured him into
a fury which lasted until he had lashed society
with the whips of his scorn.</p>
<p>Jim Irwin was not club-footed; far from it.
He was bony and rugged and homely, with a
big mouth, and wide ears, and a form stooped
with labor. He had fine, lambent, gentle eyes
which lighted up his face when he smiled, as
Lincoln&#8217;s illuminated his. He was not ugly.
In fact, if that quality which fair ladies&mdash;if
they are wise&mdash;prize far more than physical
beauty, the quality called charm, can with propriety
be ascribed to a field-hand who has just
finished a day of the rather unfragrant labor
to which I have referred, Jim Irwin possessed
charm. That is why little Jennie Woodruff
had asked him to help with her lessons, rather
oftener than was necessary, in those old days
in the Woodruff schoolhouse when Jennie wore
her hair down her back.</p>
<p>But in spite of this homely charm of personality,
Jim Irwin was set off from his fellows
of the Woodruff neighborhood in a manner
quite as segregative as was Byron by his
deformity. He was different. In local parlance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
he was an off ox. He was as odd as
Dick&#8217;s hatband. He ran in a gang by himself,
like Deacon Avery&#8217;s celebrated bull. He failed
to matriculate in the boy banditti which played
cards in the haymows on rainy days, told
stereotyped stories that smelled to heaven,
raided melon patches and orchards, swore horribly
like Sir Toby Belch, and played pool in
the village saloon. He had always liked to
read, and had piles of literature in his attic
room which was good, because it was cheap.
Very few people know that cheap literature is
very likely to be good, because it is old and unprotected
by copyright. He had Emerson,
Thoreau, a John B. Alden edition of Chambers&#8217;
<i>Encyclopedia of English Literature</i>, some
Franklin Square editions of standard poets in
paper covers, and a few Ruskins and Carlyles&mdash;all
read to rags. He talked the book English
of these authors, mispronouncing many of
the hard words, because he had never heard
them pronounced by any one except himself,
and had no standards of comparison. You find
this sort of thing in the utterances of self-educated
recluses. And he had piles of reports of

the secretary of agriculture, college bulletins
from Ames, and publications of the various bureaus
of the Department of Agriculture at
Washington. In fact, he had a good library of
publications which can be obtained gratis, or
very cheaply&mdash;and he knew their contents. He
had a personal philosophy, which while it had
cost him the world in which his fellows lived,
had given him one of his own, in which he
moved as lonely as a cloud, and as untouched of
the life about him.</p>
<p>He seemed superior to the neighbor boys,
and felt so; but this feeling was curiously mingled
with a sense of degradation. By every
test of common life, he was a failure. His
family history was a badge of failure. People
despised a man who was so incontestably
smarter than they, and yet could do no better
with himself than to work in the fields alongside
the tramps and transients and hoboes who
drifted back and forth as the casual market for
labor and the lure of the cities swept them.
Save for his mother and their cow and garden
and flock of fowls and their wretched little
rented house, he was a tramp himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>His father had been no better. He had come
into the neighborhood from nobody knows
where, selling fruit trees, with a wife and baby
in his old buggy&mdash;and had died suddenly, leaving
the baby and widow, and nothing else save
the horse and buggy. That horse and buggy
were still on the Irwin books represented by
Spot the cow&mdash;so persistent are the assets of
cautious poverty. Mrs. Irwin had labored
in kitchen and sewing room until Jim had
been able to assume the breadwinner&#8217;s burden&mdash;which
he did about the time he finished the
curriculum of the Woodruff District school.
He was an off ox and odd as Dick&#8217;s hatband,
largely because his duties to his mother and
his love of reading kept him from joining the
gangs whereof I have spoken. His duties, his
mother, and his father&#8217;s status as an outcast
were to him the equivalent of the Byronic club
foot, because they took away his citizenship in
Boyville, and drove him in upon himself, and,
at first, upon his school books which he mastered
so easily and quickly as to become the
star pupil of the Woodruff District school, and
later upon Emerson, Thoreau, Ruskin and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
poets, and the agricultural reports and
bulletins.</p>
<p>All this degraded&mdash;or exalted&mdash;him to the
position of an intellectual farm-hand, with a
sense of superiority and a feeling of degradation.
It made Jennie Woodruff&#8217;s &#8220;Humph!&#8221;
potent to keep him awake that night, and send
him to the road work with Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s
team next morning with hot eyes and a hotter
heart.</p>
<p>What was he anyhow? And what could he
ever be? What was the use of his studies in
farming practise, if he was always to be an
underling whose sole duty was to carry out the
crude ideas of his employers? And what
chance was there for a farm-hand to become a
farm owner, or even a farm renter, especially
if he had a mother to support out of the
twenty-five or thirty dollars of his monthly
wages? None.</p>
<p>A man might rise in the spirit, but how
about rising in the world?</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s gray percherons seemed
to feel the unrest of their driver, for they
fretted and actually executed a clumsy prance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
as Jim Irwin pulled them up at the end of the
turnpike across Bronson&#8217;s Slew&mdash;the said slew
being a peat-marsh which annually offered the
men of the Woodruff District the opportunity
to hold the male equivalent of a sewing circle
while working out their road taxes, with much
conversational gain, and no great damage to
the road.</p>
<p>In fact, Columbus Brown, the pathmaster,
prided himself on the Bronson Slew Turnpike
as his greatest triumph in road engineering.
The work consisted in hauling, dragging and
carrying gravel out on the low fill which carried
the road across the marsh, and then watching
it slowly settle until the next summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haul gravel from the east gravel bed, Jim,&#8221;
called Columbus Brown from the lowest spot
in the middle of the turnpike. &#8220;Take Newt
here to help load.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled his habitual slow, gentle smile at
Newton Bronson, his helper. Newton was seventeen,
undersized, tobacco-stained, profane
and proud of the fact that he had once beaten
his way from Des Moines to Faribault on
freight trains. A source of anxiety to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
father, and the subject of many predictions
that he would come to no good end, Newton
was out on the road work because he was likely
to be of little use on the farm. Clearly, Newton
was on the downward road in a double
sense&mdash;and yet, Jim Irwin rather liked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellers have put up a job on you, Jim,&#8221;
volunteered Newton, as they began filling the
wagon with gravel.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of job?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re nominating you for teacher,&#8221; replied
Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when has the position of teacher been
an elective office?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it ain&#8217;t elective,&#8221; answered Newton.
&#8220;But they say that with as many brains as
you&#8217;ve got sloshing around loose in the neighborhood,
you&#8217;re a candidate that can break the
deadlock in the school board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shoveled on silently for a while, and by
example urged Newton to earn the money
credited to his father&#8217;s assessment for the day&#8217;s
work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, what&#8217;s the use of diggin&#8217; into it like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
this?&#8221; protested Newton, who was developing
an unwonted perspiration. &#8220;None of the others
are heatin&#8217; themselves up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get any fun out of doing a good
day&#8217;s work?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fun!&#8221; exclaimed Newton. &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221;</p>
<p>A slide of earth from the top of the pit
threatened to bury Newton in gravel, sand and
good top soil. A sweet-clover plant growing
rankly beside the pit, and thinking itself perfectly
safe, came down with it, its dark green
foliage anchored by the long roots which penetrated
to a depth below the gravel pit&#8217;s bottom.
Jim Irwin pulled it loose from its anchorage,
and after looking attentively at the roots, laid
the whole plant on the bank for safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of that weed?&#8221; asked
Newton.</p>
<p>Jim picked it up and showed him the nodules
on its roots&mdash;little white knobs, smaller than
pinheads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know what they are, Newt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just white specks on the roots,&#8221; replied
Newton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The most wonderful specks in the world,&#8221;
said Jim. &#8220;Ever hear of the use of nitrates to
enrich the soil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that the stuff the old man used on the
lawn last spring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;your father used some on
his lawn. We don&#8217;t put it on our fields in
Iowa&mdash;not yet; but if it weren&#8217;t for those white
specks on the clover-roots, we should be obliged
to do so&mdash;as they do back east.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do them white specks keep us from
needin&#8217; nitrates?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long story,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;You see, before
there were any plants big enough to be
visible&mdash;if there had been any one to see them&mdash;the
world was full of little plants so small
that there may be billions of them in one of
these little white specks. They knew how to
take the nitrates from the air&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Air!&#8221; ejaculated Newton. &#8220;Nitrates in the
air! You&#8217;re crazy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;There are tons of nitrogen
in the air that press down on your head&mdash;but
the big plants can&#8217;t get it through their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
leaves, or their roots. They never had to learn,
because when the little plants&mdash;bacteria&mdash;found
that the big plants had roots with sap in them,
they located on those roots and tapped them
for the sap they needed. They began to get
their board and lodgings off the big plants.
And in payment for their hotel bills, the little
plants took nitrogen out of the air for both
themselves and their hosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean by &#8216;hosts&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their hotel-keepers&mdash;the big plants. And
now the plants that have the hotel roots for
the bacteria furnish nitrogen not only for
themselves but for the crops that follow. Corn
can&#8217;t get nitrogen out of the air; but clover
can&mdash;and that&#8217;s why we ought to plow down
clover before a crop of corn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Newt. &#8220;If you could get to
teach our school, I&#8217;d go again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would interfere with your pool playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What business is that o&#8217; yours?&#8221; interrogated
Newt defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get busy with that shovel,&#8221; suggested
Jim, who had been working steadily, driving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
out upon the fill occasionally to unload. On his
return from dumping the next load, Newton
seemed, in a superior way, quite amiably disposed
toward his workfellow&mdash;rather the habitual
thing in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll work my old man to vote for you for
the job,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;What job?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher for our school,&#8221; answered Newt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those school directors,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;have
become so bullheaded that they&#8217;ll never vote for
any one except the applicants they&#8217;ve been voting
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man says he will have Prue Foster
again, or he&#8217;ll give the school a darned long
vacation, unless Peterson and Bonner join on
some one else. That would beat Prue, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Con Bonner won&#8217;t vote for any one
but Maggie Gilmartin,&#8221; added Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; supplied Newton, &#8220;Haakon Peterson
says he&#8217;ll stick to Herman Paulson until the
Hot Springs freeze over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there you are,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;You tell
your father for me that I think he&#8217;s a mere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
mule&mdash;and that the whole district thinks the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Newt. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him that
while I&#8217;m working him to vote for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled grimly. Such a position might
have been his years ago, if he could have left
his mother or earned enough in it to keep both
alive. He had remained a peasant because the
American rural teacher is placed economically
lower than the peasant. He gave Newton&#8217;s
chatter no consideration. But when, in the
afternoon, he hitched his team with others to
the big road grader, and the gang became concentrated
within talking distance, he found
that the project of heckling and chaffing him
about his eminent fitness for a scholastic position
was to be the real entertainment of the
occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&#8217;s the candidate to bust the deadlock,&#8221;
said Columbus Brown, with a wink. &#8220;Just like
Garfield in that Republican convention he was
nominated in&mdash;eh, Con?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Con&#8221; was Cornelius Bonner, an Irishman,
one of the deadlocked school board, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
captain of the road grader. He winked back
at the pathmaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&#8217;s the gray-eyed man o&#8217; destiny,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;if he can get two votes in that board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d vote for me, wouldn&#8217;t you, Con?&#8221;
asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try annything wance,&#8221; replied Bonner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try voting with Ezra Bronson once, for
Prue Foster,&#8221; suggested Jim. &#8220;She&#8217;s done
good work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Opinions differ,&#8221; said Bonner, &#8220;an&#8217; when
you try annything just for wance, it shouldn&#8217;t
be an irrevocable shtip, me bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a reasonable board of public servants,&#8221;
said Jim ironically. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell the
whole board what I think of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down to-night,&#8221; said Bonner jeeringly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a board meeting
at the schoolhouse and ballot a few more times.
Come down, and be the Garfield of the convintion.
We&#8217;ve lacked brains on the board, that&#8217;s
clear. They ain&#8217;t a man on the board that iver
studied algebra, &#8217;r that knows more about
farmin&#8217; than their impl&#8217;yers. Come down to
the schoolhouse, and we&#8217;ll have a field-hand addriss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the school board&mdash;and begosh, I&#8217;ll move
yer illiction mesilf! Come, now, Jimmy, me
bye, be game. It&#8217;ll vary the program, anny-how.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire gang grinned. Jim flushed, and
then reconquered his calmness of spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Con,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come and tell
you a few things&mdash;and you can do as you like
about making the motion.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>REVERSED UNANIMITY</h3>
</div>

<p>The great blade of the grading machine,
running diagonally across the road and
pulling the earth toward its median line, had
made several trips, and much persiflage about
Jim Irwin&#8217;s forthcoming appearance before
the board had been addressed to Jim and exchanged
by others for his benefit.</p>
<p>To Newton Bronson was given the task of
leveling and distributing the earth rolled into
the road by the grader&mdash;a labor which in the
interests of fitting a muzzle on his big mongrel
dog he deserted whenever the machine moved
away from him. No dog would have seemed
less deserving of a muzzle, for he was a
friendly animal, always wagging his tail, pressing
his nose into people&#8217;s palms, licking their
clothing and otherwise making a nuisance of
himself. That there was some mystery about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the muzzle was evident from Newton&#8217;s pains
to make a secret of it. Its wires were curled
into a ring directly over the dog&#8217;s nose, and
into this ring Newton had fitted a cork,
through which he had thrust a large needle
which protruded, an inch-long bayonet, in
front of Ponto&#8217;s nose. As the grader swept
back, horses straining, harness creaking and
a billow of dark earth rolling before the knife,
Ponto, fully equipped with this stinger, raced
madly alongside, a friend to every man, but
not unlike some people, one whose friendship
was of all things to be most dreaded.</p>
<p>As the grader moved along one side of
the highway, a high-powered automobile approached
on the other. It was attempting to
rush the swale for the hill opposite, and
making rather bad weather of the newly repaired
road. A pile of loose soil that Newton
had allowed to lie just across the path made
a certain maintenance of speed desirable. The
knavish Newton planted himself in the path
of the laboring car, and waved its driver a
command to halt. The car came to a standstill
with its front wheels in the edge of the loose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
earth, and the chauffeur fuming at the possibility
of stalling&mdash;a contingency upon which
Newton had confidently reckoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye want?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;What
d&#8217;ye mean by stopping me in this kind of
place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to ask you,&#8221; said Newton with mock
politeness, &#8220;if you have the correct time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur sought words appropriate to
his feelings. Ponto and his muzzle saved him
the trouble. A pretty pointer leaped from the
car, and attracted by the evident friendliness
of Ponto&#8217;s greeting, pricked up its ears, and
sought, in a spirit of canine brotherhood, to
touch noses with him. The needle in Ponto&#8217;s
muzzle did its work to the agony and horror
of the pointer, which leaped back with a yelp,
and turned tail. Ponto, in an effort to apologize,
followed, and finding itself bayonetted at
every contact with this demon dog, the pointer
definitely took flight, howling, leaving Ponto
in a state of wonder and humiliation at the
sudden end of what had promised to be a very
friendly acquaintance. I have known instances
not entirely dissimilar among human beings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
The pointer&#8217;s master watched its strange
flight, and swore. His eye turned to the boy
who had caused all this, and he alighted pale
with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got time,&#8221; said he, remembering Newton&#8217;s
impudent question, &#8220;to give you what
you deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton grinned and dodged, but the bank
of loose earth was his undoing, and while he
stumbled, the chauffeur caught and held him
by the collar. And as he held the boy, the operation
of flogging him in the presence of the
grading gang grew less to his taste. Again
Ponto intervened, for as the chauffeur stood
holding Newton, the dog, evidently regarding
the stranger as his master&#8217;s friend, thrust his
nose into the chauffeur&#8217;s palm&mdash;the needle necessarily
preceding the nose. The chauffeur
behaved much as his pointer had done, saving
and excepting that the pointer did not
swear.</p>
<p>It was funny&mdash;even the pain involved could
not make it otherwise than funny. The grading
gang laughed to a man. Newton grinned
even while in the fell clutch of circumstance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Ponto tried to smell the chauffeur&#8217;s trousers,
and what had been a laugh became a roar,
quite general save for the fact that the chauffeur
did not join in it.</p>
<p>Caution and mercy departed from the chauffeur&#8217;s
mood; and he drew back his fist to strike
the boy&mdash;and found it caught by the hard hand
of Jim Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too angry to punish this boy,&#8221; said
Jim gently,&mdash;&#8220;even if you had the right to
punish him at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cut it out,&#8221; said a fat man in the rear
of the car, who had hitherto manifested no interest
in anything save Ponto. &#8220;Get in, and
let&#8217;s be on our way!&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur, however, recognized in a man
of mature years and full size, and a creature
with no mysterious needle in his nose, a relief
from his embarrassment. Unhesitatingly, he
released Newton, and blindly, furiously and futilely,
he delivered a blow meant for Jim&#8217;s jaw,
but which really miscarried by a foot. In reply,
Jim countered with an awkward swinging
uppercut, which was superior to the chauffeur&#8217;s
blow in one respect only&mdash;it landed fairly on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
point of the jaw. The chauffeur staggered and
slowly toppled over into the soft earth which
had caused so much of the rumpus. Newton
Bronson slipped behind a hedge, and took his
infernally equipped dog with him. The grader
gang formed a ring about the combatants and
waited. Colonel Woodruff, driving toward
home in his runabout, held up by the traffic
blockade, asked what was going on here, and
the chauffeur, rising groggily, picked up his
goggles, climbed into the car; and the meeting
dissolved, leaving Jim Irwin greatly embarrassed
by the fact that for the first time in his
life, he had struck a man in combat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, Jim,&#8221; said Cornelius Bonner.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think &#8217;twas in ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beastly,&#8221; said Jim, reddening. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff looked at his hired man
sharply, gave him some instructions for the
next day and drove on. The road gang dispersed
for the afternoon. Newton Bronson
carefully secreted the magic muzzle, and
chuckled at what had been perhaps the most
picturesquely successful bit of deviltry in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
varied record. Jim Irwin put out his team, got
his supper and went to the meeting of the school
board.</p>
<p>The deadlocked members of the board had
been so long at loggerheads that their relations
had swayed back to something like amity. Jim
had scarcely entered when Con Bonner addressed
the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Prisidint,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we have wid us
t&#8217;night, a young man who nades no introduction
to an audience in this place, Mr. Jim Irwin.
He thinks we&#8217;re bullheaded mules, and
that all the schools are bad. At the proper
time I shall move that we hire him f&#8217;r teacher;
and pinding that motion, I move that he be
given the floor. Ye&#8217;ve all heared of Mr. Irwin&#8217;s
ability as a white hope, and I know he&#8217;ll
be listened to wid respect!&#8221;</p>
<p>Much laughter from the board and the spectators,
as Jim arose. He looked upon it as ridicule
of himself, while Con Bonner regarded it
as a tribute to his successful speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Board,&#8221;
said Jim, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tell you anything
that you don&#8217;t know about yourselves. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
are simply making a farce of the matter of
hiring a teacher for this school. It is not as
if any of you had a theory that the teaching
methods of one of these teachers would be any
better than or much different from those of
the others. You know, and I know, that whichever
is finally engaged, or even if your silly
deadlock is broken by employing a new candidate,
the school will be the same old story. It
will still be the school it was when I came into
it a little ragged boy&#8221;&mdash;here Jim&#8217;s voice grew a
little husky&mdash;&#8220;and when I left it, a bigger boy,
but still as ragged as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a slight sensation in the audience,
as if, as Con Bonner said about the knockdown,
they hadn&#8217;t thought Jim Irwin could
do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Con, &#8220;you&#8217;ve done well to hold
your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all the years I attended this school,&#8221; Jim
went on, &#8220;I never did a bit of work in school
which was economically useful. It was all dry
stuff copied from the city schools. No other
pupil ever did any real work of the sort farmers&#8217;
boys and girls should do. We copied city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
schools&mdash;and the schools we copied are poor
schools. We made bad copies of them, too. If
any of you three men were making a fight for
what Roosevelt&#8217;s Country Life Commission
called a &#8216;new kind of rural school,&#8217; I&#8217;d say fight.
But you aren&#8217;t. You&#8217;re just making individual
fights for your favorite teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Irwin made a somewhat lengthy speech
after the awkwardness wore off, so long that
his audience was nodding and yawning by the
time he reached his peroration, in which he abjured
Bronson, Bonner and Peterson to study
his plan of a new kind of rural school,&mdash;in
which the work of the school should be correlated
with the life of the home and the farm&mdash;a
school which would be in the highest degree
cultural by being consciously useful and
obviously practical. The sharp spats of applause
from the useless hands of Newton Bronson
gave the final touch of absurdity to a situation
which Jim had felt to be ridiculous all
through. Had it not been for Jennie Woodruff&#8217;s
&#8220;Humph!&#8221; stinging him to do something
outside the round of duties into which he had
fallen, had it not been for the absurd notion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
that perhaps, after they had heard his speech,
they would place him in charge of the school,
and that he might be able to do something
really important in it, he would not have been
there. As he sat down, he felt himself a silly
clodhopper, filled with the east wind of his own
conceit, out of touch with the real world of
men. He knew himself a dreamer. The nodding
board of directors, the secretary, actually
snoring, and the bored audience restored the
field-hand to a sense of his proper place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had the privilege of list&#8217;nin&#8217;,&#8221; said
Con Bonner, rising, &#8220;to a great speech, Mr.
Prisidint. We should be proud to have a borned
orator like this in the agricultural pop&#8217;lation
of the district. A reg&#8217;lar William Jennin&#8217;s
Bryan. I don&#8217;t understand what he was trying
to tell us, but sometimes I&#8217;ve had the same
difficulty with the spaches of the Boy Orator
of the Platte. Makin&#8217; a good spache is one
thing, and teaching a good school is another,
but in order to bring this matter before the
board, I nominate Mr. James E. Irwin, the Boy
Orator of the Woodruff District, and the new
white hope, f&#8217;r the job of teacher of this school,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and I move that when he shall have received
a majority of the votes of this board, the secretary
and prisidint be insthructed to enter
into a contract with him f&#8217;r the comin&#8217; year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seconding of motions on a board of
three has its objectionable features, since it
seems to commit a majority of the body to the
motion in advance. The president, therefore,
followed usage, when he said&mdash;&#8220;If there&#8217;s no
objection, it will be so ordered. The chair
hears no objection&mdash;and it is so ordered. Prepare
the ballots for a vote on the election of
teacher, Mr. Secretary. Each votes his preference
for teacher. A majority elects.&#8221;</p>
<p>For months, the ballots had come out of the
box&mdash;an empty crayon-box&mdash;Herman Paulson,
one; Prudence Foster, one; Margaret Gilmartin,
one; and every one present expected the
same result now. There was no surprise, however,
in view of the nomination of Jim Irwin
by the blarneying Bonner when the secretary
smoothed out the first ballot, and read: &#8220;James
E. Irwin, one.&#8221; Clearly this was the Bonner
vote; but when the next slip came forth, &#8220;James
E. Irwin, two,&#8221; the Board of Directors of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Woodruff Independent District were stunned
at the slowly dawning knowledge that they had
made an election! Before they had rallied, the
secretary drew from the box the third and last
ballot, and read, &#8220;James E. Irwin, three.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Bronson choked as he announced
the result&mdash;choked and stammered, and made
very hard weather of it, but he went through
with the motion, as we all run in our grooves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ballot having shown the unanimous
election of James E. Irwin, I declare him
elected.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped into his chair, while the secretary,
a very methodical man, drew from his
portfolio a contract duly drawn up save for the
signatures of the officers of the district, and
the name and signature of the teacher-elect.
This he calmly filled out, and passed over to the
president, pointing to the dotted line. Mr.
Bronson would have signed his own death-warrant
at that moment, not to mention a
perfectly legal document, and signed with
Peterson and Bonner looking on stonily. The
secretary signed and shoved the contract over
to Jim Irwin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sign there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jim looked it over, saw the other signatures,
and felt an impulse to dodge the whole thing.
He could not feel that the action of the board
was serious. He thought of the platform he
had laid down for himself, and was daunted.
He thought of the days in the open field, and
of the untroubled evenings with his books, and
he shrank from the work. Then he thought of
Jennie Woodruff&#8217;s &#8220;Humph!&#8221;&mdash;and he signed!</p>
<p>&#8220;Move we adjourn,&#8221; said Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;No &#8217;bjection &#8217;t&#8217;s so ordered!&#8221; said Mr.
Bronson.</p>
<p>The secretary and Jim went out, while the
directors waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the Billy&mdash;&#8221; began Bonner, and finished
lamely! &#8220;What for did you vote for the
dub, Ez?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I voted for him,&#8221; replied Bronson, &#8220;because
he fought for my boy this afternoon. I didn&#8217;t
want it stuck into him too hard. I wanted him
to have <i>one</i> vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I wanted him to have wan vote, too,&#8221;
said Bonner. &#8220;I thought mesilf the only dang
fool on the board&mdash;an&#8217; he made a spache that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
airned wan vote&mdash;but f&#8217;r the love of hivin, that
dub f&#8217;r a teacher! What come over you,
Haakon&mdash;you voted f&#8217;r him, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay vanted him to have one wote, too,&#8221; said
Peterson.</p>
<p>And in this wise, Jim became the teacher in
the Woodruff District&mdash;all on account of Jennie
Woodruff&#8217;s &#8220;Humph!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WHAT IS A BROWN MOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Immediately upon the accidental election
of Jim Irwin to the position of teacher of
the Woodruff school, he developed habits somewhat
like a ghost&#8217;s or a bandit&#8217;s. That is, he
walked of nights and on rainy days.</p>
<p>On fine days, he worked in Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s
fields as of yore. Had he been appointed to a
position attached to a salary of fifty thousand
dollars a year, he might have spent six months
on a preliminary vacation in learning something
about his new duties. But Jim&#8217;s salary
was to be three hundred and sixty dollars for
nine months&#8217; work in the Woodruff school, and
he was to find himself&mdash;and his mother. Therefore,
he had to indulge in his loose habits of
night walking and roaming about after hours
only, or on holidays and in foul weather.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>The Simms family, being from the mountings
of Tennessee, were rather startled one night,
when Jim Irwin, homely, stooped and errandless,
silently appeared in their family circle
about the front door. They had lived where it
was the custom to give a whoop from the big
road before one passed through the palin&#8217;s and
up to the house. Otherwise, how was one to
know whether the visitor was friend or foe?</p>
<p>From force of habit, Old Man Simms started
for his gun-rack at Jim&#8217;s appearance, but the
Lincolnian smile and the low slow speech, so
much like his own in some respects, ended that
part of the matter. Besides, Old Man Simms
remembered that none of the Hobdays, whose
hostilities somewhat stood in the way of the
return of the Simmses to their native hills,
could possibly be expected to appear thus in
Iowa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said Mr. Simms, after greetings
had been exchanged, &#8220;you&#8217;re right welcome,
but in my kentry you&#8217;d find it dangersome to
walk in thisaway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; queried Jim Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d more&#8217;n likely git shot up some,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Mr. Simms, &#8220;onless you whooped from
the big road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;m
ignorant of the customs of other countries.
Would you rather I&#8217;d whoop from the big
road&mdash;nobody else will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; replied Mr. Simms, &#8220;that we-all
will have to accommodate ourse&#8217;ves to the
ways hyeh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidently Jim was the Simms&#8217; first caller
since they had settled on the little brushy tract
whose hills and trees reminded them of their
mountains. Low hills, to be sure, with only
a footing of rocks where the creek had cut
through, and not many trees, but down in the
creek bed, with the oaks, elms and box-elders
arching overhead, the Simmses could imagine
themselves beside some run falling into the
French Broad, or the Holston. The creek bed
was a withdrawing room in which to retire
from the eternal black soil and level corn-fields
of Iowa. What if the soil was so poor,
in comparison with those black uplands, that
the owner of the old wood-lot could find no
renter? It was better than the soil in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
mountains, and suited the lonesome Simmses
much more than a better farm would have
done. They were not of the Iowa people anyhow,
not understood, not their equals&mdash;they
were pore, and expected to stay pore&mdash;while
the Iowa people all seemed to be either well-to-do,
or expecting to become so. It was much
more agreeable to the Simmses to retire to the
back wood-lot farm with the creek bed running
through it.</p>
<p>Jim Irwin asked Old Man Simms about the
fishing in the creek, and whether there was any
duck shooting spring and fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;We git right smart of these little panfish,&#8221;
said Mr. Simms, &#8220;an&#8217; Calista done shot two
butterball ducks about &#8216;tater-plantin&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calista blushed&mdash;but this stranger, so much
like themselves, could not see the rosy suffusion.
The allusion gave him a chance to look about
him at the family. There was a boy of sixteen,
a girl&mdash;the duck-shooting Calista&mdash;younger
than Raymond&mdash;a girl of eleven, named Virginia,
but called Jinnie&mdash;and a smaller lad
who rejoiced in the name of McGeehee, but was
mercifully called Buddy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Calista squirmed for something to say.
&#8220;Raymond runs a line o&#8217; traps when the fur&#8217;s
prime,&#8221; she volunteered.</p>
<p>Then came a long talk on traps and trapping,
shooting, hunting and the joys of the mountings&mdash;during
which Jim noted the ignorance
and poverty of the Simmses. The clothing of
the girls was not decent according to local
standards; for while Calista wore a skirt hurriedly
slipped on, Jim was quite sure&mdash;and not
without evidence to support his views&mdash;that
she had been wearing when he arrived the
same regimentals now displayed by Jinnie&mdash;a
pair of ragged blue overalls. Evidently the
Simmses were wearing what they had and not
what they desired. The father was faded,
patched, gray and earthy, and the boys looked
better than the rest solely because we expect
boys to be torn and patched. Mrs. Simms was
invisible except as a gray blur beyond the rain-barrel,
in the midst of which her pipe glowed
with a regular ebb and flow of embers.</p>
<p>On the next rainy day Jim called again and
secured the services of Raymond to help him
select seed corn. He was going to teach the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
school next winter, and he wanted to have a
seed-corn frolic the first day, instead of waiting
until the last&mdash;and you had to get seed corn
while it was on the stalk, if you got the best.
No Simms could refuse a favor to the fellow
who was so much like themselves, and who
was so greatly interested in trapping, hunting
and the Tennessee mountains&mdash;so Raymond
went with Jim, and with Newt Bronson and
five more they selected Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s seed
corn for the next year, under the colonel&#8217;s
personal superintendence.</p>
<p>In the evening they looked the grain over
on the Woodruff lawn, and the colonel talked
about corn and corn selection. They had supper
at half past six, and Jennie waited on them&mdash;having
assisted her mother in the cooking.
It was quite a festival. Jim Irwin was the
least conspicuous person in the gathering, but
the colonel, who was a seasoned politician, observed
that the farm-hand had become a fisher
of men, and was angling for the souls of these
boys, and their interest in the school. Jim was
careful not to flush the covey, but every boy
received from the next winter&#8217;s teacher some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
confidential hint as to plans, and some suggestion
that Jim was relying on the aid and comfort
of that particular boy. Newt Bronson,
especially, was leaned on as a strong staff and
a very present help in time of trouble. As
for Raymond Simms, it was clearly best to
leave him alone. All this talk of corn selection
and related things was new to him, and he
drank it in thirstily. He had an inestimable
advantage over Newt in that he was starved,
while Newt was surfeited with &#8220;advantages&#8221;
for which he had no use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennie,&#8221; said Colonel Woodruff, after the
party had broken up, &#8220;I&#8217;m losing the best hand
I ever had, and I&#8217;ve been sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s leaving you,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;He
ought to do something except work in the field
for wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had no idea he could make good as a
teacher&mdash;and what is there in it if he does?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he lost if he doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; rejoined
Jennie. &#8220;And why can&#8217;t he make good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The school board&#8217;s against him, for one
thing,&#8221; replied the colonel. &#8220;They&#8217;ll fire him if
they get a chance. They&#8217;re the laughing-stock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
of the country for hiring him by mistake, and
they&#8217;re irritated. But after seeing him perform
to-night, I wonder if he can&#8217;t make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he could <i>feel</i> like anything but an underling
he&#8217;d succeed,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his heredity,&#8221; stated the colonel,
whose live-stock operations were based on
heredity. &#8220;Jim&#8217;s a scrub, I suppose; but he
acts as if he might turn out to be a Brown
Mouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, pa,&#8221; scoffed Jennie&mdash;&#8220;a
Brown Mouse!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow in Edinburgh,&#8221; said the colonel,
&#8220;crossed the Japanese waltzing mouse with the
common white mouse. Jim&#8217;s pedling father
was a waltzing mouse, no good except to jump
from one spot to another for no good reason.
Jim&#8217;s mother is an albino of a woman, with all
the color washed out in one way or another. Jim
ought to be a mongrel, and I&#8217;ve always considered
him one. But the Edinburgh fellow
every once in a while got out of his variously-colored,
waltzing and albino hybrids, a brown
mouse. It wasn&#8217;t a common house mouse,
either, but a wild mouse unlike any he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
ever seen. It ran away, and bit and
gnawed, and raised hob. It was what we breeders
call a Mendelian segregation of genetic
factors that had been in the waltzers and albinos
all the time&mdash;their original wild ancestor
of the woods and fields. If Jim turns out to be
a Brown Mouse, he may be a bigger man than
any of us. Anyhow, I&#8217;m for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to be a big man to make anything
out of the job of a country school-teacher,&#8221; said
Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any job&#8217;s as big as the man who holds it
down,&#8221; said her father.</p>
<p>Next day, Jim received a letter from Jennie.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Dear Jim,&#8221; it ran. &#8220;Father says you are
sure to have a hard time&mdash;the school board&#8217;s
against you, and all that. But he added, &#8216;I&#8217;m
for Jim, anyhow!&#8217; I thought you&#8217;d like to know
this. Also he said, &#8216;Any job&#8217;s as big as the man
who holds it down,&#8217; And I believe this also,
<i>and I&#8217;m for you, too!</i> You are doing wonders
even before the school starts in getting the
pupils interested in a lot of things, which, while
they don&#8217;t belong to school work, will make
them friends of yours. I don&#8217;t see how this
will help you much, but it&#8217;s a fine thing, and
shows your interest in them. Don&#8217;t be too
original. The wheel runs easiest in the beaten
track. Yours. Jennie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Jennie&#8217;s caution made no impression on Jim&mdash;but
he put the letter away, and every evening
took it out and read the italicized words, <i>&#8220;I&#8217;m
for you, too!&#8221;</i> The colonel&#8217;s dictum, &#8220;Any job&#8217;s
as big as the man who holds it down,&#8221; was
an Emersonian truism to Jim. It reduced all
jobs to an equality, and it meant equality in
intellectual and spiritual development. It
didn&#8217;t mean, for instance, that any job was as
good as another in making it possible for a
man to marry&mdash;and Jennie Woodruff&#8217;s
&#8220;Humph!&#8221; returned to kill and drag off her
&#8220;I&#8217;m for you, too!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL</h3>
</div>

<p>I suppose every reader will say that genius
consists very largely in seeing Opportunity
in the set of circumstances or thoughts or impressions
that constitute Opportunity, and
making the best of them.</p>
<p>Jim Irwin would have said so, anyhow. He
was full of his Emerson&#8217;s <i>Representative Men</i>,
and his Carlyle&#8217;s <i>French Revolution</i>, and the
other old-fashioned, excellent good literature
which did not cost over twenty-five cents a
volume; and he had pored long and with many
thrills over the pages of Matthews&#8217; <i>Getting on
in the World</i>&mdash;which is the best book of purely
conventional helpfulness in the language. And
his view of efficiency was that it is the capacity
to see opportunity where others overlook it,
and make the most of it.</p>
<p>All through his life he had had his own plans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
for becoming great. He was to be a general,
hurling back the foes of his country; he was
to be the nation&#8217;s master in literature; a successful
drawing on his slate had filled him
with ambition, confidently entertained, of becoming
a Rubens&mdash;and the story of Benjamin
West in his school reader fanned this spark
to a flame; science, too, had at times been his
chosen field; and when he had built a mousetrap
which actually caught mice, he saw himself
a millionaire inventor. As for being president,
that was a commonplace in his dreams.
And all the time, he was barefooted, ill-clad
and dreamed his dreams to the accompaniment
of the growl of the plow cutting the roots
under the brown furrow-slice, or the wooshing
of the milk in the pail. At twenty-eight, he
considered these dreams over.</p>
<p>As for this new employment, he saw no great
opportunity in it. Of any spark of genius he
was to show in it, of anything he was to suffer
in it, of those pains and penalties wherewith
the world pays its geniuses, Jim Irwin anticipated
nothing. He went into the small, mean,
ill-paid task as a part of the day&#8217;s work, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
no knowledge of the stirring of the nation for
a different sort of rural school, and no suspicion
that there lay in it any highway to success
in life. He was not a college man or even
a high-school man. All his other dreams had
found rude awakening in the fact that he had
not been able to secure the schooling which
geniuses need in these days. He was unfitted
for the work geniuses do. All he was to be
was a rural teacher, accidentally elected by a
stupid school board, and with a hard tussle
before him to stay on the job for the term of
his contract. He could have accepted positions
quite as good years ago, save for the fact that
they would have taken him away from his
mother, their cheap little home, their garden
and their fowls. He rather wondered why
he had allowed Jennie&#8217;s sneer to sting him
into the course of action which put him in this
new relation to his neighbors.</p>
<p>But, true to his belief in honest thorough
work, like a general preparing for battle, he
examined his field of operations. His manner
of doing this seemed to prove to Colonel Woodruff,
who watched it with keen interest as something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
new in the world, that Jim Irwin was
possibly a Brown Mouse. But the colonel knew
only a part of Jim&#8217;s performances. He saw
Jim clothed in slickers, walking through rainstorms
to the houses in the Woodruff District,
as greedy for every moment of rain as a haymaker
for shine; and he knew that Jim made
a great many evening calls.</p>
<p>But he did not know that Jim was making
what our sociologists call a survey. For that
matter, neither did Jim; for books on sociology
cost more than twenty-five cents a volume, and
Jim had never seen one. However, it was a
survey. To be sure, he had long known everybody
in the district, save the Simmses&mdash;and he
was now a friend of all that exotic race; but
there is knowing and knowing. He now had
note-books full of facts about people and their
farms. He knew how many acres each family
possessed, and what sort of farming each husband
was doing&mdash;live stock, grain or mixed.
He knew about the mortgages, and the debts.
He knew whether the family atmosphere was
happy and contented, or the reverse. He knew
which boys and girls were wayward and insubordinate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
He made a record of the advancement
in their studies of all the children, and
what they liked to read. He knew their favorite
amusements. He talked with their mothers
and sisters&mdash;not about the school, to any extent,
but on the weather, the horses, the automobiles,
the silo-filling machinery and the
profits of farming.</p>
<p>I suppose that no person who has undertaken
the management of the young people of any
school in all the history of education, ever did
so much work of this sort before his school
opened. Really, though Jennie Woodruff did
not see how such doings related to school
work, Jim Irwin&#8217;s school was running full blast
in the homes of the district and the minds of
many pupils, weeks and weeks before that day
when he called them to order on the Monday
specified in his contract as the first day of
school.</p>
<p>Con Bonner, who came to see the opening,
voiced the sentiments of the older people when
he condemned the school as disorderly. To be
sure, there were more pupils enrolled than
had ever entered on a first day in the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
history of the school, and it was hard to accommodate
them all. But the director&#8217;s criticism
was leveled against the free-and-easy air
of the children. Most of them had brought
seed corn and a good-sized corn show was on
view. There was much argument as to the
merits of the various entries. Instead of a
language lesson from the text-book, Jim had
given them an exercise based on an examination
of the ears of corn.</p>
<p>The number exercises of the little chaps had
been worked out with ears and kernels of corn.
One class in arithmetic calculated the percentage
of inferior kernels at tip and butt to the
full-sized grains in the middle of the ear.</p>
<p>All the time, Jim Irwin, awkward and
uncouth, clad in his none-too-good Sunday suit
and trying to hide behind his Lincolnian smile
the fact that he was pretty badly frightened
and much embarrassed, passed among them,
getting them enrolled, setting them to work,
wasting much time and laboring like a heavy-laden
barge in a seaway.</p>
<p>&#8220;That feller&#8217;ll never do,&#8221; said Bonner to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Bronson next day. &#8220;Looks like a tramp in the
schoolroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wearin&#8217; his best, I guess,&#8221; said Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half the kids call him &#8216;Jim,&#8217;&#8221; said Bonner.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right with me,&#8221; replied Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The room was as noisy as a caucus,&#8221; was
Bonner&#8217;s next indictment, &#8220;and the flure was
all over corn like a hog-pin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t suppose he can get away with
it,&#8221; assented Bronson disgustedly, &#8220;but that
boy of mine is as tickled as a colt with the
whole thing. Says he&#8217;s goin&#8217; reg&#8217;lar this
winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because Jim don&#8217;t keep no order,&#8221;
said Bonner. &#8220;He lets Newt do as he dam
pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First time he&#8217;s ever pleased to do anything
but deviltry,&#8221; protested Bronson. &#8220;Oh, I suppose
Jim&#8217;ll fall down, and we&#8217;ll have to fire
him&mdash;but I wish we could git a <i>good</i> teacher
that would git hold of Newt the way he
seems to!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE PROMOTION OF JENNIE</h3>
</div>

<p>If Jennie Woodruff was the cause of Jim
Irwin&#8217;s sudden irruption into the educational
field by her scoffing &#8220;Humph!&#8221; at the idea
of a farm-hand&#8217;s ever being able to marry, she
also gave him the opportunity to knock down
the driver of the big motor-car, and perceptibly
elevate himself in the opinion of the neighborhood,
while filling his own heart with something
like shame.</p>
<p>The fat man who had said &#8220;Cut it out&#8221; to his
driver, was Mr. Charles Dilly, a business man
in the village at the extreme opposite corner
of the county. His choice of the Woodruff District
as a place for motoring had a secret explanation.
I am under no obligation to preserve
the secret. He came to see Colonel Woodruff
and Jennie. Mr. Dilly was a candidate for
county treasurer, and wished to be nominated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
at the approaching county convention. In his
part of the county lived the county superintendent&mdash;a
candidate for renomination. He
was just a plain garden or field county superintendent
of schools, no better and no worse than
the general political run of them, but he had
local pride enlisted in his cause, and was a
good politician.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilly was in the Woodruff District to
build a backfire against this conflagration of
the county superintendent. He expected to use
Jennie Woodruff to light it withal. That is,
while denying that he wished to make any deal
or trade&mdash;every candidate in every convention
always says that&mdash;he wished to say to Miss
Woodruff and her father, that if Miss Woodruff
would permit her name to be used for the
office of county superintendent of schools, a
goodly group of delegates could be selected in
the other corner of the county who would be
glad to reciprocate any favors Mr. Charles J.
Dilly might receive in the way of votes for
county treasurer with ballots for Miss Jennie
Woodruff for superintendent of schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilly never inquired as to Miss Woodruff&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
abilities as an educator. That would
have been eccentric. Miss Woodruff never
asked herself if she knew anything about rural
education which especially fitted her for the
task; for was she not a popular and successful
teacher&mdash;and was not that enough? Mr. Dilly
merely asked himself if Miss Woodruff&#8217;s name
could command strength enough to eliminate
the embarrassing candidate in his part of the
county and leave the field to himself. Miss
Woodruff asked herself whether the work
would not give her a pleasanter life than did
teaching, a better salary, and more chances
to settle herself in life. So are the officials
chosen who supervise and control the education
of the farm children of America.</p>
<p>This secret mission to effect a political trade
accounted for Mr. Dilly&#8217;s desire that his driver
should &#8220;cut out&#8221; the controversy with Newton
Bronson, and the personal encounter with Jim
Irwin&mdash;and it may account for Jim&#8217;s easy victory
in his first and only physical encounter.
An office seeker could scarcely afford to let his
friend or employee lick a member of a farmers&#8217;
road gang. It certainly explains the fact that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
when Jim Irwin started home from putting
out his team the day after his first call on the
Simms family, Jennie was waiting at the gate
to be congratulated on her nomination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Jennie, extending her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re elected,&#8221; Jim went on, holding
the hand; &#8220;but there&#8217;s no doubt of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They say not,&#8221; replied Jennie; &#8220;but father
says I must go about and let the people see
me. He believes in working just as if we didn&#8217;t
have a big majority for the ticket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman has an advantage of a man in
such a contest,&#8221; said Jim; &#8220;she can work just
as hard as he can, and at the same time profit
by the fact that it&#8217;s supposed she can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need all the advantage I possess,&#8221; said
Jennie, &#8220;and all the votes. Say a word for me
when on your pastoral rounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;what shall I say you&#8217;ll
do for the schools?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jennie, rather perplexed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be fair in my examinations of teachers, try to
keep the unfit teachers out of the schools, visit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
schools as often as I can, and&mdash;why, what does
any good superintendent do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of a good county superintendent,&#8221;
said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard of one&mdash;why, Jim Irwin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is any such thing,&#8221;
persisted Jim, &#8220;and if you do no more than you
say, you&#8217;ll be off the same piece as the rest.
Your system won&#8217;t give us any better schools
than we have&mdash;of the old sort&mdash;and we need a
new kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim, Jim! Dreaming as of yore! Why
can&#8217;t you be practical! What do you mean by
a new kind of rural school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A truly-rural rural school,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t pronounce it,&#8221; smiled Jennie, &#8220;to say
nothing of understanding it. What would your
tralalooral rural school do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be correlated with rural life,&#8221; said
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would get education out of the things the
farmers and farmers&#8217; wives are interested in
as a part of their lives.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What, for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dairying, for instance, in this district; and
soil management; and corn-growing; and farm
manual training for boys; and sewing, cooking
and housekeeping for the girls&mdash;and caring for
babies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie looked serious, after smothering a
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to have a hard
enough time to succeed in the Woodruff school,
if you confine yourself to methods that have
been tested, and found good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the old methods,&#8221; urged Jim, &#8220;have
been tested and found bad. Shall I keep to
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have made the American people what
they are,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be unpatriotic,
Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have educated our farm children for
the cities,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;This county is losing
population&mdash;and it&#8217;s the best county in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pessimism never wins,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither does blindness,&#8221; answered Jim. &#8220;It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
is losing the farms their dwellers, and swelling
the cities with a proletariat.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some time, now, Jim had ceased to hold
Jennie&#8217;s hand; and their sweetheart days had
never seemed farther away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;I may be elected to a
position in which I shall be obliged to pass on
your acts as teacher&mdash;in an official way, I mean.
I hope they will be justifiable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled his slowest and saddest smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re not, I&#8217;ll not ask you to condone
them,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But first, they must be justifiable
to me, Jennie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; said Jennie curtly, and left
him.</p>
<p>Jennie, I am obliged to admit, gave scant
attention to the new career upon which her old
sweetheart seemed to be entering. She was
in politics, and was playing the game as became
the daughter of a local politician. The
reader must not by this term get the impression
that Colonel Woodruff was a man of the
grafting tricky sort of which we are prone to
think when the term is used. The West has
been ruled by just such men as he, and the West
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
has done rather well, all things considered.
Colonel Albert Woodruff went south with the
army as a corporal in 1861, and came back a
lieutenant. His title of colonel was conferred
by appointment as a member of the staff of
the governor, long years ago, when he was
county auditor. He was not a rich man, as I
may have suggested, but a well-to-do farmer,
whose wife did her own work much of the
time, not because the colonel could not afford
to hire &#8220;help,&#8221; but for the reason that &#8220;hired
girls&#8221; were hard to get.</p>
<p>The colonel, having seen the glory of the
coming of the Lord in the triumph of his side
in the great war, was inclined to think that all
reform had ceased, and was a political stand-patter&mdash;a
very honest and sincere one. Moreover,
he was influential enough so that when
Mr. Cummins or Mr. Dolliver came into the
county on political errands, Colonel Woodruff
had always been called into conference. He
was of the old New England type, believed
very much in heredity, very much in the theory
that whatever is is right, in so far as it has
secured money or power.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>He had hated General Weaver and his forces;
and had sometimes wondered how a man of
Horace Boies&#8217; opinions had succeeded in being
so good a governor. He broke with Governor
Larrabee when that excellent man had turned
against the great men who had developed Iowa
by building the railroads. He was always in
the county convention, and preferred to serve
on the committee on credentials, and leave to
others the more showy work of membership in
the committee on resolutions. He believed in
education, provided it did not unsettle things.
He had a good deal of Latin and some Greek,
and lived on a farm rather than in a fine
house in the county seat because of his lack
of financial ability. As a matter of fact, he
had been too strictly scrupulous to do the
things&mdash;such as dealing in lands belonging to
eastern speculators who were not advised as
to their values, speculating in county warrants,
buying up tax titles with county money, and
the like&mdash;by which his fellow-politicians who
held office in the early years of the county had
founded their fortunes. A very respectable,
honest, American tory was the colonel, fond of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
his political sway, and rather soured by the
fact that it was passing from him. He had
now broken with Cummins and Dolliver as he
had done years ago with Weaver and later with
Larrabee&mdash;and this breach was very important
to him, whether they were greatly concerned
about it or not.</p>
<p>Such being her family history, Jennie was
something of a politician herself. She was in
no way surprised when approached by party
managers on the subject of accepting the nomination
for county superintendent of schools.
Colonel Woodruff could deliver some delegates
to his daughter, though he rather shied at the
proposal at first, but on thinking it over,
warmed somewhat to the notion of having a
Woodruff on the county pay-roll once more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>JIM TALKS THE WEATHER COLD</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Going to the rally, James?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim had finished his supper, and yearned
for a long evening in his attic den with his
cheap literature. But as the district schoolmaster
he was to some extent responsible for
the protection of the school property, and felt
some sense of duty as to exhibiting an interest
in public affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to go, mother,&#8221; he replied
regretfully. &#8220;I want to see Mr. Woodruff about
borrowing his Babcock milk tester, and I&#8217;ll go
that way. I guess I&#8217;ll go on to the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed his mother when he went&mdash;a habit
from which he never deviated, and another of
those personal peculiarities which had marked
him as different from the other boys of the
neighborhood. His mother urged his overcoat
upon him in vain&mdash;for Jim&#8217;s overcoat was distinctly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
a bad one, while his best suit, now worn
every day as a concession to his scholastic
position, still looked passably well after several
weeks of schoolroom duty. She pressed him
to wear a muffler about his neck, but he declined
that also. He didn&#8217;t need it, he said;
but he was thinking of the incongruity of a
muffler with no overcoat. It seemed more
logical to assume that the weather was milder
than it really was, on that sharp October evening,
and appear at his best, albeit rather aware
of the cold. Jennie was at home, and he was
likely to see and be seen of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can borrow that tester,&#8221; said the
colonel, &#8220;and the cows that go with it, if you
can use &#8217;em. They ain&#8217;t earning their keep
here. But how does the milk tester fit into
the curriculum of the school? A decoration?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make a few tests of the cows
in the neighborhood,&#8221; answered Jim. &#8220;Just
another of my fool notions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;Take it along.
Going to the speakin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, he&#8217;s going,&#8221; said Jennie, entering.
&#8220;This is my meeting, Jim.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, I&#8217;m going,&#8221; assented Jim. &#8220;And I
think I&#8217;ll run along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we had room for you in the car,&#8221;
said the colonel. &#8220;But I&#8217;m going around by
Bronson&#8217;s to pick up the speaker, and I&#8217;ll have
a chuck-up load.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so much of a load as you think,&#8221; said
Jennie. &#8220;I&#8217;m going with Jim. The walk will
do me good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Any candidate warms to her voting population
just before election; but Jennie had a
special kindness for Jim. He was no longer
a farm-hand. The fact that he was coming
to be a center of disturbance in the district,
and that she quite failed to understand how
his eccentric behavior could be harmonized
with those principles of teaching which she
had imbibed at the state normal school in
itself lifted him nearer to equality with her.
A public nuisance is really more respectable
than a nonentity.</p>
<p>She gave Jim a thrill as she passed through
the gate that he opened for her. White moonlight
on her white furs suggested purity, exaltation,
the essence of womanhood&mdash;things far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
finer in the woman of twenty-seven than the
glamour thrown over him by the schoolgirl
of sixteen.</p>
<p>Jim gave her no thrill; for he looked gaunt
and angular in his skimpy, ready-made suit, too
short in legs and sleeves, and too thin for the
season. Yet, as they walked along, Jim grew
upon her. He strode on with immense strides,
made slow to accommodate her shorter steps,
and embarrassing her by his entire absence of
effort to keep step. For all that, he lifted his
face to the stars, and he kept silence, save for
certain fragments of his thoughts, in dropping
which he assumed that she, like himself, was
filled with the grandeur of the sparkling sky, its
vast moon, plowing like an astronomical liner
through the cloudlets of a wool-pack. He
pointed out the great open spaces in the Milky
Way, wondering at their emptiness, and at the
fact that no telescope can find stars in them.</p>
<p>They stopped and looked. Jim laid his hard
hands on the shoulders of her white fur collarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of political meetings,&#8221; said
Jim, &#8220;when you and I can stand here and think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
our way out, even beyond the limits of our
Universe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wonderful journey,&#8221; said she, not quite
understanding his mood, but very respectful to
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And together,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go on
a long, long journey with you to-night, Jennie,
to make up for the years since we went anywhere
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we shouldn&#8217;t have come together
to-night,&#8221; said Jennie, getting back to earth,
&#8220;if I hadn&#8217;t exercised my leap-year privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped her arm in his, and they went
on in a rather intimate way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not to blame, Jennie,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
know that at any time I&#8217;d have given anything&mdash;anything&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And even now,&#8221; said Jennie, taking
advantage of his depleted stock of words, &#8220;while
we roam beyond the Milky Way, we aren&#8217;t
getting any votes for me for county superintendent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim said nothing. He was quite, quite
reestablished on the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to be elected, Jim?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Jim seemed to ponder this for some time&mdash;a
period of taking the matter under advisement
which caused Jennie to drop his arm and busy
herself with her skirts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jim, at last; &#8220;of course I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said until they reached
the schoolhouse door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jennie rather indignantly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad there are plenty of voters who are more
enthusiastic about me than you seem to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>More interesting to a keen observer than
the speeches, were the unusual things in the
room itself. To be sure, there were on the
blackboards exercises and outlines, of lessons
in language, history, mathematics, geography
and the like. But these were not the usual
things taken from text-books. The problems in
arithmetic were calculations as to the feeding
value of various rations for live stock, records
of laying hens and computation as to the excess
of value in eggs produced over the cost of feed.
Pinned to the wall were market reports on all
sorts of farm products, and especially numerous
were the statistics on the prices of cream and
butter. There were files of farm papers piled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
about, and racks of agricultural bulletins. In
one corner of the room was a typewriting machine,
and in another a sewing machine. Parts
of an old telephone were scattered about on
the teacher&#8217;s desk. A model of a piggery stood
on a shelf, done in cardboard. Instead of the
usual collection of text-books in the desk, there
were hectograph copies of exercises, reading
lessons, arithmetical tables and essays on
various matters relating to agriculture, all of
which were accounted for by two or three
hand-made hectographs&mdash;a very fair sort of
printing plant&mdash;lying on a table. The members
of the school board were there, looking on
these evidences of innovation with wonder and
more or less disfavor. Things were disorderly.
The text-books recently adopted by the board
against some popular protest had evidently
been pitched, neck and crop, out of the school
by the man whom Bonner had termed a dub.
It was a sort of contempt for the powers
that be.</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff was in the chair. After
the speechifying was over, and the stereotyped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
though rather illogical, appeal had been made
for voters of the one party to cast the straight
ticket, and for those of the other faction to
scratch, the colonel rose to adjourn the meeting.</p>
<p>Newton Bronson, safely concealed behind
taller people, called out, &#8220;Jim Irwin! speech!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a giggle, a slight sensation, and
many voices joined in the call for the new
schoolmaster.</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff felt the unwisdom of
ignoring the demand. Probably he relied upon
Jim&#8217;s discretion and expected a declination.</p>
<p>Jim arose, seedy and lank, and the voices
ceased, save for another suppressed titter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;whether this call
upon me is a joke or not. If it is, it isn&#8217;t a
practical one, for I can&#8217;t talk. I don&#8217;t care
much about parties or politics. I don&#8217;t know
whether I&#8217;m a Democrat, a Republican or a
Populist.&#8221;</p>
<p>This caused a real sensation. The nerve of
the fellow! Really, it must in justice be said,
Jim was losing himself in a desire to tell his
true feelings. He forgot all about Jennie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
her candidacy&mdash;about everything except his
real, true feelings. This proves that he was no
politician.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see much in this county campaign
that interests me,&#8221; he went on&mdash;and Jennie
Woodruff reddened, while her seasoned father
covered his mouth with his hand to conceal a
smile. &#8220;The politicians come out into the farming
districts every campaign and get us hayseeds
for anything they want. They always
have got us. They&#8217;ve got us again! They
give us clodhoppers the glad hand, a cheap
cigar, and a cheaper smile after election;&mdash;and
that&#8217;s all. I know it, you all know it, they
know it. I don&#8217;t blame them so very much.
The trouble is we don&#8217;t ask them to do anything
better. I want a new kind of rural school;
but I don&#8217;t see any prospect, no matter how
this election goes, for any change in them. We
in the Woodruff District will have to work out
our own salvation. Our political ring never&#8217;ll
do anything but the old things. They don&#8217;t
want to, and they haven&#8217;t sense enough to do
it if they did. That&#8217;s all&mdash;and I don&#8217;t suppose
I should have said as much as I have!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>There was stark silence for a moment when he
sat down, and then as many cheers for Jim as
for the principal speaker of the evening, cheers
mingled with titters and catcalls. Jim felt a
good deal as he had done when he knocked
down Mr. Billy&#8217;s chauffeur&mdash;rather degraded
and humiliated, as if he had made an ass of
himself. And as he walked out of the door,
the future county superintendent passed by
him in high displeasure, and walked home with
some one else.</p>
<p>Jim found the weather much colder than it
had been while coming. He really needed an
Eskimo&#8217;s fur suit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE NEW WINE</h3>
</div>

<p>In the little strip of forest which divided the
sown from the Iowa sown wandered two
boys in earnest converse. They seemed to be
Boy Trappers, and from their backloads of
steel-traps one of them might have been Frank
Merriwell, and the other Dead-Shot Dick.
However, though it was only mid-December,
and the fur of all wild varmints was at its
primest, they were bringing their traps into the
settlements, instead of taking them afield.
&#8220;The settlements&#8221; were represented by the
ruinous dwelling of the Simmses, and the boy
who resembled Frank Merriwell was Raymond
Simms. The other, who was much more barbarously
accoutered, whose overalls were
fringed, who wore a cartridge belt about his
person, and carried hatchet, revolver, and a
long knife with a deerfoot handle, and who so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
studiously looked like Dead-Shot Dick, was our
old friend of the road gang, Newton Bronson.
On the right, on the left, a few rods would
have brought the boys out upon the levels of
rich corn-fields, and in sight of the long rows
of cottonwoods, willows, box-elders and soft
maples along the straight roads, and of the huge
red barns, each of which possessed a numerous
progeny of outbuildings, among which the
dwelling held a dubious headship. But here,
they could be the Boy Trappers&mdash;a thin fringe
of bushes and trees made of the little valley a
forest to the imagination of the boys. Newton
put down his load, and sat upon a stump to
rest.</p>
<p>Raymond Simms was dimly conscious of a
change in Newton since the day when they
met and helped select Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s next
year&#8217;s seed corn. Newton&#8217;s mother had a
mother&#8217;s confidence that Newton was now a
good boy, who had been led astray by other
boys, but had reformed. Jim Irwin had a
distinct feeling of optimism. Newton had quit
tobacco and beer, casually stating to Jim that
he was &#8220;in training.&#8221; Since Jim had shown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
his ability to administer a knockout to that
angry chauffeur, he seemed to this hobbledehoy
peculiarly a proper person for athletic confidences.
Newton&#8217;s mind seemed gradually
filling up with interests that displaced the
psychological complex out of which oozed the
bad stories and filthy allusion. Jim attributed
much of this to the clear mountain atmosphere
which surrounded Raymond Simms, the
ignorant barbarian driven out of his native
hills by a feud. Raymond was of the open
spaces, and refused to hear fetid things that
seemed out of place in them. There was a
dignity which impressed Newton, in the blank
gaze with which Raymond greeted Newton&#8217;s
sallies that were wont to set the village pool
room in a roar; but how could you have a fuss
with a feller who knew all about trapping, who
had seen a man shot, who had shot a bear, who
had killed wild turkeys, who had trapped a
hundred dollars&#8217; worth of furs in one winter,
who knew the proper &#8220;sets&#8221; for all fur-bearing
animals, and whom you liked, and who liked
you?</p>
<p>As the reason for Newton&#8217;s improvement in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
manner of living, Raymond, out of his own
experience, would have had no hesitation in
naming the school and the schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go back on a friend,&#8221; said Newton,
seated on the stump with his traps on the
ground at his feet, &#8220;the way you&#8217;re going back
on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got no call to talk thataway,&#8221; replied
the mountain boy. &#8220;How&#8217;m I goin&#8217; back on
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We was goin&#8217; to trap all winter,&#8221;
asseverated Newton, &#8220;and next winter we were
goin&#8217; up in the north woods together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Raymond somberly, &#8220;that
we cain&#8217;t run any trap line and do whut we
got to do to he&#8217;p Mr. Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton sat mute as one having no rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Jim,&#8221; went on Raymond, &#8220;needs all the
he&#8217;p every kid in this settlement kin give him.
He&#8217;s the best friend I ever had. I&#8217;m a pore
ignerant boy, an&#8217; he teaches me how to do
things that will make me something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn it all!&#8221; said Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Raymond, &#8220;that you&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
think mahgty small of me, if I&#8217;d desert Mr. Jim
Irwin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; replied Newton, seizing his
traps and throwing them across his shoulder,
&#8220;come on with the traps, and shut up! What&#8217;ll
we do when the school board gets Jennie Woodruff
to revoke his certificate and make him quit
teachin&#8217;, hey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll eveh do that,&#8221; said Raymond. &#8220;I&#8217;d
set in the schoolhouse do&#8217; with my rifle and
shoot anybody that&#8217;d come to th&#8217;ow Mr. Jim
outen the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in this country,&#8221; said Newton. &#8220;This
ain&#8217;t a gun country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it orto be either a justice kentry, or a
gun kentry,&#8221; replied the mountain boy. &#8220;It
stands to reason it must be one &#8217;r the otheh,
Newton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it don&#8217;t, neither,&#8221; said Newton dogmatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should they th&#8217;ow Mr. Jim outen the
school?&#8221; inquired Raymond. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t he teachin&#8217;
us right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton explained for the tenth time that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
father, Mr. Con Bonner and Mr. Haakon Peterson
had not meant to hire Jim Irwin at all, but
each had voted for him so that he might have
one vote. They were all against him from the
first, but they had not known how to get rid
of him. Now, however, Jim had done so many
things that no teacher was supposed to do, and
had left undone so many things that teachers
were bound by custom to perform, that Newton&#8217;s
father and Mr. Bonner and Mr. Peterson
had made up up their minds that they would call
upon him to resign, and if he wouldn&#8217;t, they
would &#8220;turn him out&#8221; in some way. And the
best way if they could do it, would be to induce
County Superintendent Woodruff, who didn&#8217;t
like Jim since the speech he made at the political
meeting, to revoke his certificate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What wrong&#8217;s he done committed?&#8221; asked
Raymond. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what teachers air
supposed to do in this kentry, but Mr. Jim
seems to be the only shore-enough teacher I
ever see!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t teach out of the books the school
board adopted,&#8221; replied Newton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he makes up better lessons,&#8221; urged Raymond.
&#8220;An&#8217; all the things we do in school,
he&#8217;ps us make a livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He begins at eight in the mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said
Newton, &#8220;an&#8217; he has some of us there till half
past five, and comes back in the evening. And
every Saturday, some of the kids are doin&#8217;
something at the schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t pay him for overtime, do they?&#8221;
queried Raymond. &#8220;Well, then, they orto,
instid of turnin&#8217; him out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ll turn him out!&#8221; prophesied
Newton. &#8220;I&#8217;m havin&#8217; more fun in school than
I ever&mdash;an&#8217; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m with you on this
quittin&#8217; trapping&mdash;but they&#8217;ll get Jim, all
right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having something betteh&#8217;n fun,&#8221; replied
Raymond. &#8220;My pap has never understood this
kentry, an&#8217; we-all has had bad times hyeh; but
Mr. Jim an&#8217; I have studied out how I can make
a betteh livin&#8217; next year&mdash;and pap says we kin
go on the way Mr. Jim says. I&#8217;ll work for
Colonel Woodruff a part of the time, an&#8217; pap
kin make corn in the biggest field. It seems
we didn&#8217;t do our work right last year&mdash;an&#8217; in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
a couple of years, with the increase of the
hawgs, an&#8217; the land we kin get under plow....&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymond was off on his pet dream of becoming
something better than the oldest of the
Simms tribe of outcasts, and Newton was subconsciously
impressed by the fact that never
for a moment did Raymond&#8217;s plans fail to include
the elevation with him of Calista and
Jinnie and Buddy and Pap and Mam. It was
taken for granted that the Simmses sank or
swam together, whether their antagonists were
poverty and ignorance, or their ancient foes,
the Hobdays. Newton drew closer to Raymond&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>It was still an hour before nine&mdash;when the
rural school traditionally &#8220;takes up&#8221;&mdash;when
the boys had stored their traps in a shed at the
Bronson home, and walked on to the schoolhouse.
That rather scabby and weathered
edifice was already humming with industry of
a sort. In spite of the hostility of the school
board, and the aloofness of the patrons of the
school, the pupils were clearly interested in
Jim Irwin&#8217;s system of rural education. Never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
had the attendance been so large or regular;
and one of the reasons for sessions before nine
and after four was the inability of the teacher
to attend to the needs of his charges in the
five and a half hours called &#8220;school hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, however, was not the sole reason. It
was the new sort of work which commanded
the attention of Raymond and Newton as they
entered. This morning, Jim had arranged in
various sorts of dishes specimens of grain and
grass seeds. By each was a card bearing the
name of the farm from which one of the older
boys or girls had brought it. &#8220;Wheat, Scotch
Fife, from the farm of Columbus Smith.&#8221;
&#8220;Timothy, or Herd&#8217;s Grass, from the farm of
A. B. Talcott.&#8221; &#8220;Alsike Clover, from the farm
of B. B. Hamm.&#8221; Each lot was in a small cloth
bag which had been made by one of the little
girls as a sewing exercise; and each card had
been written as a lesson in penmanship by one
of the younger pupils, and contained, in addition
to the data above mentioned, heads under
which to enter the number of grains of the
seed examined, the number which grew, the
percentage of viability, the number of alien
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
seeds of weeds and other sorts, the names of
these adulterants, the weight of true and
vitalized, and of foul and alien and dead seeds,
the value per bushel in the local market of the
seeds under test, and the real market values
of the samples, after dead seeds and alien
matter had been subtracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now get busy, here,&#8221; cried Jim Irwin.
&#8220;We&#8217;re late! Raymond, you&#8217;ve a quick eye&mdash;you
count seeds&mdash;and you, Calista, and Mary
Smith&mdash;and mind, next year&#8217;s crop may depend
on making no mistakes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistakes!&#8221; scoffed Mary Smith, a dumpy
girl of fourteen. &#8220;We don&#8217;t make mistakes
any more, teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a frolic, rather than a task. All had
come with a perfect understanding that this
early attendance was quite illegal, and not to
be required of them&mdash;but they came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Newt,&#8221; suggested Jim, &#8220;get busy on the
percentage problems for that second class in
arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Newt. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see.... Good
seed is the base, and bad seed and dead seed
the percentage&mdash;find the rate....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Make them
easy and plain and as many as you can get
out&mdash;and be sure that you name the farm every
pop!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got you!&#8221; answered Newton, and in a fine
frenzy went at the job of creating a text-book
in arithmetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buddy,&#8221; said Jim, patting the youngest
Simms on the head, &#8220;you and Virginia can
print the reading lessons this morning, can&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Jim,&#8221; answered both McGeehee
Simms and his sister cheerily. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the
copy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; answered the teacher, handing each
a typewritten sheet for use as the original from
which the young mountaineers were to make
hectograph copies, &#8220;and mind you make good
copies! Bettina Hansen pretty nearly cried
last night because she had to write them over
so many times on the typewriter before she
got them all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reading lesson was an article on corn
condensed from a farm paper, and a selection
from <i>Hiawatha</i>&mdash;the Indian-corn myth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be careful, Mr. Jim,&#8221; said Buddy.</p>
<p>Half past eight, and only half an hour until
school would officially be &#8220;called.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton Bronson was writing in aniline ink
for the hectographs, such problems as these:</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Ezra Bronson&#8217;s seed wheat carries
in each 250 grains, ten cockle grains, fifteen
rye grains, twenty fox-tail seeds, three iron-weed
seeds, two wild oats grains, twenty-seven
wild buckwheat seeds, one wild morning-glory
seed, and eighteen lamb&#8217;s quarter seeds, what
percentage of the seeds sown is wheat, and
what foul seed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If in each 250 grains of wheat in Mr.
Bronson&#8217;s bins, 30 are cracked, dead or otherwise
not capable of sprouting, what per cent,
of the seed sown will grow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the foul seed and dead wheat amount to
one-eighth by weight of the mass, what did
Mr. Bronson pay per bushel for the good wheat,
if it cost him $1.10 in the bin, and what per
cent, did he lose by the adulterations and the
poor wheat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim ran over these rapidly. &#8220;Your mathematics
is good, Newton,&#8221; said the schoolmaster,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
&#8220;but if you expect to pass in penmanship, you&#8217;ll
have to take more pains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the grammar?&#8221; asked Newton.
&#8220;The writing is pretty bad, I&#8217;ll own up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The grammar is good this morning. You&#8217;re
gradually mastering the art of stating a problem
in arithmetic in English&mdash;and that&#8217;s improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hands of Jim Irwin&#8217;s dollar watch
gradually approached the position indicating
nine o&#8217;clock&mdash;at which time the schoolmaster
rapped on his desk and the school came to
order. Then, for a while, it became like other
schools. A glance over the room enabled him
to enter the names of the absentees, and those
tardy. There was a song by the school, the
recitation in concert of <i>Little Brown Hands</i>,
some general remarks and directions by the
teacher, and the primary pupils came forward
for their reading exercises. A few classes began
poring over their text-books, but most of
the pupils had their work passed out to them in
the form of hectograph copies of exercises
prepared in the school itself.</p>
<p>As the little ones finished their recitations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
they passed to the dishes of wheat, and began
aiding Raymond&#8217;s squad in the counting and
classifying of the various seeds. They counted
to five, and they counted the fives. They
laughed in a subdued way, and whispered constantly,
but nobody seemed disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they help much, Calista?&#8221; asked the
teacher, as the oldest Simms girl came to his
desk for more wheat.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh, not much,&#8221; replied Calista, beaming,
&#8220;but they don&#8217;t hold us back any&mdash;and
maybe they do he&#8217;p a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and they enjoy
it, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Mr. Jim,&#8221; assented Calista, &#8220;and
the way Buddy is learnin&#8217; to count is fine!
They-all will soon know all the addition they
is, and a lot of multiplication. Angie Talcott
knows the kinds of seeds better&#8217;n what I do!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AND THE OLD BOTTLES</h3>
</div>

<p>The day passed. Four o&#8217;clock came. In
order that all might reach home for supper,
there was no staying, except that Newt Bronson
and Raymond Simms remained to sweep
and dust the schoolroom, and prepare kindling
for the next morning&#8217;s fire&mdash;a work they had
taken upon themselves, so as to enable the
teacher to put on the blackboards such outlines
for the morrow&#8217;s class work as might be required.
Jim was writing on the board a list
of words constituting a spelling exercise. They
were not from the text-book, but grew naturally
out of the study of the seed wheat&mdash;&#8220;cockle,&#8221;
&#8220;morning-glory,&#8221; &#8220;convolvulus,&#8221; &#8220;viable,&#8221; &#8220;viability,&#8221;
&#8220;sprouting,&#8221; &#8220;iron-weed&#8221; and the like.
A tap was heard at the door, and Raymond
Simms opened it.</p>
<p>In filed three women&mdash;and Jim Irwin knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
as he looked at them that he was greeting a
deputation, and felt that it meant a struggle.
For they were the wives of the members of
the school board. He placed for them the three
available chairs, and in the absence of any for
himself remained standing before them, a gaunt
shabby-looking revolutionist at the bar of
settled usage and fixed public opinion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Haakon Peterson was a tall blonde
woman who, when she spoke betrayed her
Scandinavian origin by the northern burr to
her &#8220;r&#8217;s,&#8221; and a slight difficulty with her &#8220;j&#8217;s,&#8221;
her &#8220;y&#8217;s&#8221; and long &#8220;a&#8217;s.&#8221; She was slow-spoken
and dignified, and Jim felt an instinctive respect
for her personality. Mrs. Bronson was
a good motherly woman, noted for her
housekeeping, and for her church activities.
She looked oftener at her son, and his friend
Raymond than at the schoolmaster. Mrs. Bonner
was the most voluble of the three, and was
the only one who shook hands with Jim; but
in spite of her rather offhand manner, Jim
sensed in the little, black-eyed Irishwoman the
real commander of the expedition against
him&mdash;for such he knew it to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may think it strange of us coming
after hours,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but we wanted to
speak to you, teacher, without the children
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish more of the parents would call,&#8221;
said Jim. &#8220;At any hour of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or night either, I dare say,&#8221; suggested Mrs.
Bonner. &#8220;I hear you&#8217;ve the scholars here at
all hours, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled his slow patient smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do break the union rules, I guess, Mrs.
Bonner,&#8221; said he; &#8220;there seems to be more to
do than we can get done during school
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What right have ye,&#8221; struck in Mrs. Bonner,
&#8220;to be burning the district&#8217;s fuel, and wearing
out the school&#8217;s property out of hours like
that&mdash;not that it&#8217;s anny of my business,&#8221; she
interposed, hastily, as if she had been diverted
from her chosen point of attack. &#8220;I just
thought of it, that&#8217;s all. What we came for,
Mr. Irwin, is to object to the way the teachin&#8217;s
being done&mdash;corn and wheat, and hogs and the
like, instead of the learnin&#8217; schools was made
to teach.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Schools were made to prepare children for
life, weren&#8217;t they, Mrs. Bonner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; went on Mrs. Bonner, &#8220;I can
see an&#8217; the whole district can see that it&#8217;s
easier for a man that&#8217;s been a farm-hand to
teach farm-hand knowledge, than the learnin&#8217;
schools was set up to teach; but if so be he
hasn&#8217;t the book education to do the right thing,
we think he should get out and give a real
teacher a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I neglecting?&#8221; asked Jim mildly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonner seemed unprepared for the
question, and sat for an instant mute. Mrs.
Peterson interposed her attack while Mrs. Bonner
might be recovering her wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We people that have had a hard time,&#8221; she
said in a precise way which seemed to show
that she knew exactly what she wanted, &#8220;want
to give our boys and girls a chance to live
easier lives than we lived. We don&#8217;t want our
children taught about nothing but work. We
want higher things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Peterson,&#8221; said Jim earnestly, &#8220;we
must have first things first. Making a living
is the first thing&mdash;and the highest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haakon and I will look after making a
living for our family,&#8221; said she. &#8220;We want
our children to learn nice things, and go to
high school, and after a while to the Juniwersity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; declared Jim, &#8220;will send out from
this school, if you will let me, pupils better
prepared for higher schools than have ever
gone from it&mdash;because they will be trained to
think in terms of action. They will go knowing
that thoughts must always be linked with
things. Aren&#8217;t your children happy in school,
Mrs. Peterson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t send them to school to be happy,
Yim,&#8221; replied Mrs. Peterson, calling him by
the name most familiarly known to all of them;
&#8220;I send them to learn to be higher people than
their father and mother. That&#8217;s what America
means!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be higher people&mdash;higher than their
parents&mdash;higher than their teacher&mdash;they&#8217;ll be
efficient farmers, and efficient farmers&#8217; wives.
They&#8217;ll be happy, because they will know how
to use more brains in farming than any lawyer
or doctor or merchant can possibly use in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
business. I&#8217;m educating them to find an outlet
for genius in farming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine thing,&#8221; said Mrs. Bonner, coming
to the aid of her fellow soldiers, &#8220;to work hard
for a lifetime, an&#8217; raise nothing but a family
of farmers! A fine thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be farmers anyhow,&#8221; cried Jim,
&#8220;in spite of your efforts&mdash;ninety out of every
hundred of them! And of the other ten, nine
will be wage-earners in the cities, and wish to
God they were back on the farm; and the
hundredth one will succeed in the city. Shall
we educate the ninety-and-nine to fail, that the
hundredth, instead of enriching the rural life
with his talents, may steal them away to make
the city stronger? It is already too strong
for us farmers. Shall we drive our best away
to make it stronger?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guns of Mrs. Bonner and Mrs. Peterson
were silenced for a moment, and Mrs. Bronson,
after gazing about at the typewriter, the hectograph,
the exhibits of weed seeds, the Babcock
milk tester, and the other unscholastic equipment,
pointed to the list of words, and the
arithmetic problems on the board.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you get them words from the speller?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we got them from a lesson on
seed wheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did them examples come out of an arithmetic
book?&#8221; cross-examined she.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;we used problems we made
ourselves. We were figuring profits and losses
on your cows, Mrs. Bronson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ezra Bronson,&#8221; said Mrs. Bronson loftily,
&#8220;don&#8217;t need any help in telling what&#8217;s a good
cow. He was farming before you was born!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like fun, he don&#8217;t need help! He&#8217;s going
to dry old Cherry off and fatten her for beef;
and he can make more money on the cream by
beefing about three more of &#8217;em. The Babcock
test shows they&#8217;re just boarding on us without
paying their board!&#8221;</p>
<p>The delegation of matrons ruffled like a group
of startled hens at this interposition, which
was Newton Bronson&#8217;s effective seizing of the
opportunity to issue a progress bulletin in the
research work on the Bronson dairy herd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Newton!&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;don&#8217;t interrupt
me when I&#8217;m talking to the teacher!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Newton, &#8220;don&#8217;t tell the
teacher that pa knew which cows were good
and which were poor. If any one in this
district wants to know about their cows they&#8217;ll
have to come to this shop. And I can tell you
that it&#8217;ll pay &#8217;em to come too, if they&#8217;re going
to make anything selling cream. Wait until
we get out our reports on the herds, ma!&#8221;</p>
<p>The women were rather stampeded by this
onslaught of the irregular troops&mdash;especially
Mrs. Bronson. She was placed in the position
of a woman taking a man&#8217;s wisdom from her
ne&#8217;er-do-well son for the first time in her life.
Like any other mother in this position, she
felt a flutter of pride&mdash;but it was strongly
mingled with a motherly desire to spank him.
The deputation rose, with a unanimous feeling
that they had been scored upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cows!&#8221; scoffed Mrs. Peterson. &#8220;If we leave
you in this yob, Mr. Irwin, our children will
know nothing but cows and hens and soils and
grains&mdash;and where will the culture come in?
How will our boys and girls appear when we
get fixed so we can move to town? We won&#8217;t
have no culture at all, Yim!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Culture!&#8221; exclaimed Jim. &#8220;Why&mdash;why,
after ten years of the sort of school I would
give you if I were a better teacher, and could
have my way, the people of the cities would
be begging to have their children admitted so
that they might obtain real culture&mdash;culture
fitting them for life in the twentieth century&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother to get ready for the city
children, Jim,&#8221; said Mrs. Bonner sneeringly,
&#8220;you won&#8217;t be teaching the Woodruff school
that long.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this time, the dark-faced Cracker had
been glooming from a corner, earnestly seeking
to fathom the wrongness he sensed in the
gathering. Now he came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I may be making a mistake to say
anything,&#8221; said he, &#8220;f&#8217;r we-all is strangers
hyeh, an&#8217; we&#8217;re pore; but I must speak out
for Mr. Jim&mdash;I must! Don&#8217;t turn him out,
folks, f&#8217;r he&#8217;s done mo&#8217; f&#8217;r us than eveh any
one done in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Mrs. Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Raymond, &#8220;that when Mr. Jim
began talking school to us, we was a pore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
no-&#8217;count lot without any learnin&#8217;, with nothin&#8217;
to talk about except our wrongs, an&#8217; our enemies,
and the meanness of the Iowa folks.
You see we didn&#8217;t understand you-all. An&#8217;
now, we have hope. We done got hope from
this school. We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to make good in the
world. We&#8217;re getting education. We&#8217;re all
learnin&#8217; to use books. My little sister will be
as good as anybody, if you&#8217;ll just let Mr. Jim
alone in this school&mdash;as good as any one. An&#8217;
I&#8217;ll he&#8217;p pap get a farm, and we&#8217;ll work and
think at the same time, an&#8217; be happy!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>JENNIE ARRANGES A CHRISTMAS PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The great party magnates who made up the
tickets from governor down to the lowest
county office, doubtless regarded the little political
plum shaken off into the apron of Miss
Jennie Woodruff of the Woodruff District, as
the very smallest and least bloomy of all the
plums on the tree; but there is something which
tends to puff one up in the mere fact of having
received the votes of the people for any office,
especially in a region of high average civilization,
covering six hundred or seven hundred
square miles of good American domain. Jennie
was a sensible country girl. Being sensible,
she tried to avoid uppishness. But she did feel
some little sense of increased importance as she
drove her father&#8217;s little one-cylinder runabout
over the smooth earth roads, in the crisp December
weather, just before Christmas.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>The weather itself was stimulating, and she
was making rapid progress in the management
of the little car which her father had offered
to lend her for use in visiting the one hundred
or more rural schools soon to come under her
supervision. She rather fancied the picture
of herself, clothed in more or less authority and
queening it over her little army of teachers.</p>
<p>Mr. Haakon Peterson was phlegmatically
conscious that she made rather an agreeable
picture, as she stopped her car alongside his
top buggy to talk with him. She had bright
blue eyes, fluffy brown hair, a complexion
whipped pink by the breeze, and she smiled
at him ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think father is lovely?&#8221; said she.
&#8220;He is going to let me use the runabout when
I visit the schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be good,&#8221; said Haakon. &#8220;It will
save you lots of time. I hope you make the
county pay for the gasoline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought about that,&#8221; said Jennie.
&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s been so nice to me&mdash;I want to
give as well as receive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Haakon, &#8220;you will yust begin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
to receive when your salary begins in Yanuary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve received much
more than that now! You don&#8217;t know how
proud I feel. So many nice men I never knew
before, and all my old friends like you working
for me in the convention and at the polls, just
as if I amounted to something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know how proud I feel,&#8221;
said Haakon, &#8220;to have in county office a little
girl I used to hold on my lap.&#8221;</p>
<p>In early times, when Haakon was a flat-capped
immigrant boy, he had earned the initial
payment on his first eighty acres of prairie
land as a hired man on Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s
farm. Now he was a rather richer man than
the colonel, and not a little proud of his ascent
to affluence. He was a mild-spoken, soft-voiced
Scandinavian, quite completely Americanized,
and possessed of that aptitude for local politics
which makes so good a citizen of the Norwegian
and Swede. His influence was always
worth fifty to sixty Scandinavian votes in any
county election. He was a good party man
and conscious of being entitled to his voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
in party matters. This seemed to him an opportunity
for exerting a bit of political
influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yennie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this man Yim Irwin
needs to be lined up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lined up! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way he is doing in the school,&#8221; said
Haakon, &#8220;is all wrong. If you can&#8217;t line him
up, he will make you trouble. We must look
ahead. Everybody has his friends, and Yim
Irwin has his friends. If you have trouble
with him, his friends will be against you when
we want to nominate you for a second term.
The county is getting close. If we go to conwention
without your home delegation it would
weaken you, and if we nominate you, every
piece of trouble like this cuts down your wote.
You ought to line him up and have him do
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is so funny,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;He likes you,&#8221; said Haakon. &#8220;You can line
him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie blushed, and to conceal her slight embarrassment,
got out for the purpose of cranking
her machine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But if I can not line him up?&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tank,&#8221; said Haakon, &#8220;if you can&#8217;t line him
up, you will have a chance to rewoke his certificate
when you take office.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jim Irwin was to be crushed like an insect.
The little local gearing of the big party
machine was to crush him. Jennie dimly sensed
the tragedy of it, but very dimly. Mainly she
thought of Mr. Peterson&#8217;s suggestion as to
&#8220;lining up&#8221; Jim Irwin as so thoroughly sensible
that she gave it a good deal of thought that
day. She could not help feeling a little resentment
at Jim for following his own fads and
fancies so far. We always resent the necessity
of crushing any weak creature which must
needs be wiped out. The idea that there could
be anything fundamentally sane in his overturning
of the old and tried school methods
under which both he and she had been educated,
was absurd to Jennie. To be sure, everybody
had always favored &#8220;more practical education,&#8221;
and Jim&#8217;s farm arithmetic, farm physiology,
farm reading and writing, cow-testing
exercises, seed analysis, corn clubs and the tomato,
poultry and pig clubs he proposed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
have in operation the next summer, seemed
highly practical; but to Jennie&#8217;s mind, the fact
that they introduced dissension in the neighborhood
and promised to make her official life
vexatious, seemed ample proof that Jim&#8217;s work
was visionary and impractical. Poor Jennie
was not aware of the fact that new truth always
comes bringing, not peace to mankind, but a
sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said she that night, &#8220;let&#8217;s have a
little Christmas party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;Whom shall
we invite?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I want to invite
Jim Irwin and his mother, and nobody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; reiterated the colonel. &#8220;But
why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;I want to see whether I
can talk Jim out of some of his foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to line him up, do you?&#8221; said the
colonel. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good politics, and incidentally,
you may get some good ideas out of
Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather unlikely,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said the colonel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
smiling. &#8220;I begin to think that Jim&#8217;s a Brown
Mouse. I&#8217;ve told you about the Brown Mouse,
haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;You&#8217;ve told me. But
Professor Darbishire&#8217;s brown mice were simply
wild and incorrigible creatures. Just because
it happens to emerge suddenly from the forests
of heredity, it doesn&#8217;t prove that the Brown
Mouse is any good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin Morgan was a Brown Mouse,&#8221; said
the colonel. &#8220;And he founded the greatest
breed of horses in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;because you&#8217;re
a lover of the Morgan horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Napoleon Bonaparte was a Brown Mouse,&#8221;
said the colonel. &#8220;So was George Washington,
and so was Peter the Great. Whenever a
Brown Mouse appears he changes things in
a little way or a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the better, always?&#8221; asked Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;The Brown Mouse
may throw back to slant-headed savagery. But
Jim ... sometimes I think Jim is the kind of
Mendelian segregation out of which we get
Franklins and Edisons and their sort. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
may get some good ideas out of Jim. Let us
have them here for Christmas, by all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>In due time Jennie&#8217;s invitation reached Jim
and his mother, like an explosive shell fired
from a distance into their humble dwelling&mdash;quite
upsetting things. Twenty-five years constitute
rather a long wait for social recognition,
and Mrs. Irwin had long since regarded
herself as quite outside society. To be sure,
for something like half of this period, she
had been of society if not in it. She had done
the family washings, scrubbings and cleanings,
had made the family clothes and been a woman
of all work, passing from household to household,
in an orbit determined by the exigencies
of threshing, harvesting, illness and child-bearing.
At such times she sat at the family
table and participated in the neighborhood gossip,
in quite the manner of a visiting aunt or
other female relative; but in spite of the democracy
of rural life, there is and always has
been a social difference between a hired woman
and an invited guest. And when Jim, having
absorbed everything which the Woodruff school
could give him in the way of education, found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
his first job at &#8220;making a hand,&#8221; Mrs. Irwin,
at her son&#8217;s urgent request, ceased going out
to work for a while, until she could get back
her strength. This she had never succeeded
in doing, and for a dozen years or more had
never entered a single one of the houses in
which she had formerly served.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go, James,&#8221; said she; &#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can! Why not?&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t go anywhere,&#8221; urged Mrs.
Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no reason,&#8221; said her son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a thing to wear,&#8221; said Mrs. Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to wear!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if any ordinary person can understand
the shock with which Jim Irwin heard
those words from his mother&#8217;s lips. He was
approaching thirty, and the association of the
ideas of Mother and Costume was foreign to
his mind. Other women had surfaces different
from hers, to be sure&mdash;but his mother was not
as other women. She was just Mother, always
at work in the house or in the garden, always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
doing for him those inevitable things which
made up her part in life, always clothed in the
browns, grays, gray-blues, neutral stripes and
checks which were cheap and common and
easily made. Clothes! They were in the Irwin
family no more than things by which the
rules of decency were complied with, and the
cold of winter turned back&mdash;but as for their
appearance! Jim had never given the thing
a thought further than to wear out his Sunday
best in the schoolroom, to wonder where the
next suit of Sunday best was to come from,
and to buy for his mother the cheap and common
fabrics which she fashioned into the garments
in which alone, it seemed to him, she
would seem like Mother. A boy who lives
until he is nearly thirty in intimate companionship
with Carlyle, Thoreau, Wordsworth,
Shakespeare, Emerson, Professor Henry, Liberty
H. Bailey, Cyril Hopkins, Dean Davenport
and the great obscurities of the experiment stations,
may be excused if his views regarding
clothes are derived in a transcendental manner
from <i>Sartor Resartus</i> and the agricultural college
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
tests as to the relation between Shelter
and Feeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think it would
be pretty hard to explain to the Woodruffs that
you stayed away because of clothes. They have
seen you in the clothes you wear pretty often
for the last thirty years!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Was a woman ever quite without a costume?</p>
<p>Mrs. Irwin gazed at vacancy for a while,
and went to the old bureau. From the bottom
drawer she took an old, old black alpaca dress&mdash;a
dress which Jim had never seen. She
spread it out on her bed in the alcove off the
combined kitchen, parlor and dining-room in
which they lived, and smoothed out the wrinkles.
It was almost whole, save for the places
where her body, once so much fuller than now,
had drawn the threads apart&mdash;under the arms,
and at some of the seams&mdash;and she handled it
as one deals with something very precious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d wear it again,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;but once. I&#8217;ve been saving it for my last
dress. But I guess it won&#8217;t hurt to wear it once
for the benefit of the living.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>Jim kissed his mother&mdash;a rare thing, save
as the caress was called for by the established
custom between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of that, mother,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for
years and years yet!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>HOW JIM WAS LINED UP</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no doubt that Jennie Woodruff
was justified in thinking that they were a
queer couple. They weren&#8217;t like the Woodruffs,
at all. They were of a different pattern.
To be sure, Jim&#8217;s clothes were not especially
noteworthy, being just shiny, and frayed at
cuff and instep, and short of sleeve and leg,
and ill-fitting and cheap. They betrayed poverty,
and the inability of a New York sweatshop
to anticipate the prodigality of Nature in
the matter of length of leg and arm, and
wealth of bones and joints which she had lavished
upon Jim Irwin. But the Woodruff table
had often enjoyed Jim&#8217;s presence, and the
standards prevailing there as to clothes were
only those of plain people who eat with their
hired men, buy their clothes at a county seat
town, and live simply and sensibly on the fat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
of the land. Jim&#8217;s queerness lay not so much
in his clothes as in his personality.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jennie could not help
thinking that Mrs. Irwin&#8217;s queerness was to be
found almost solely in her clothes. The black
alpaca looked undeniably respectable, especially
when it was helped out by a curious old
brooch of goldstone, bordered with flowers in
blue and white and red and green&mdash;tiny blossoms
of little stones which looked like the
flowers which grow at the snow line on Pike&#8217;s
Peak. Jennie felt that it must be a cheap affair,
but it was decorative, and she wondered
where Mrs. Irwin got it. She guessed it must
have a story&mdash;a story in which the stooped,
rusty, somber old lady looked like a character
drawn to harmonize with the period just after
the war. For the black alpaca dress looked
more like a costume for a masquerade than a
present-day garment, and Mrs. Irwin was so
oppressed with doubt as to whether she was
presentable, with knowledge that her dress
didn&#8217;t fit, and with the difficulty of behaving
naturally&mdash;like a convict just discharged from
prison after a ten years&#8217; term&mdash;that she took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
on a stiffness of deportment quite in keeping
with the idea that she was a female Rip Van
Winkle not yet quite awake. But Jennie had
the keenness to see that if Mrs. Irwin could
have had an up-to-date costume she would have
become a rather ordinary and not bad-looking
old lady. What Jennie failed to divine was
that if Jim could have invested a hundred dollars
in the services of tailors, haberdashers,
barbers and other specialists in personal appearance,
and could for this hour or so have
blotted out his record as her father&#8217;s field-hand,
he would have seemed to her a distinguished-looking
young man. Not handsome, of course,
but the sort people look after&mdash;and follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to dinner,&#8221; said Mrs. Woodruff, who
at this juncture had a hired girl, but was yoked
to the oar nevertheless when it came to turkey
and the other fixings of a Christmas dinner.
&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough, what there is of it, and
there&#8217;s enough of it such as it is&mdash;but the dressing
in the turkey would be better for a little
more sage!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bountiful meal piled mountain high for
guest and hired help and family melted away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
in a manner to delight the hearts of Mrs.
Woodruff and Jennie. The colonel, in stiff
starched shirt, black tie and frock coat, carved
with much empressement, and Jim felt almost
for the first time a sense of the value of manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had bigger turkeys,&#8221; said Mrs. Woodruff
to Mrs. Irwin, &#8220;but I thought it would be better
to cook two turkey-hens instead of one
great big gobbler with meat as tough as tripe
and stuffed full of fat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the hens would &#8217;a&#8217; been plenty,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Irwin. &#8220;How much did they
weigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About fifteen pounds apiece,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;The gobbler would &#8217;a&#8217; weighed thirty,
I guess. He&#8217;s pure Mammoth Bronze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that we could get a few
breeding birds of the wild bronze turkeys from
Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the original blood of the domestic
bronze turkeys,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and they&#8217;re bigger
and handsomer than the pure-bred bronzes,
even. They&#8217;re a better stock than the northern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
wild turkeys from which our common birds
originated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you learn all these things, Jim?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Woodruff. &#8220;I declare, I often tell
Woodruff that it&#8217;s as good as a lecture to have
Jim Irwin at table. My intelligence has fallen
since you quit working here, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came into Jim&#8217;s eyes the gleam of the
man devoted to a Cause&mdash;and the dinner tended
to develop into a lecture. Jennie saw a little
more plainly wherein his queerness lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an education in any meal, if we
would just use the things on the table as materials
for study, and follow their trails back
to their starting-points. This turkey takes us
back to the chaparral of Mexico&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s chaparral?&#8221; asked Jennie, as a diversion.
&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the words I have seen
so often and know perfectly to speak it and
read it&mdash;but after all it&#8217;s just a word, and
nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that the trouble with our education,
Jim?&#8221; queried the colonel, cleverly steering
Jim back into the track of his discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not even living words,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Jim, &#8220;unless we have clothed them in flesh and
blood through some sort of concrete notion.
&#8216;Chaparral&#8217; to Jennie is just the ghost of a
word. Our civilization is full of inefficiency because
we are satisfied to give our children these
ghosts and shucks and husks of words, instead
of the things themselves, that can be seen and
hefted and handled and tested and heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie looked Jim over carefully. His queerness
was taking on a new phase&mdash;and she felt
a sense of surprise such as one experiences
when the conjurer causes a rose to grow into
a tree before your very eyes. Jim&#8217;s development
was not so rapid, but Jennie&#8217;s perception
of it was. She began to feel proud of the fact
that a man who could make his impractical notions
seem so plausible&mdash;and who was clearly
fired with some sort of evangelistic fervor&mdash;had
kissed her, once or twice, on bringing her
home from the spelling school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we lose so much time in school,&#8221;
Jim went on, &#8220;while the children are eating
their dinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jim,&#8221; said Mrs. Woodruff, &#8220;every one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
but you is down on the human level. The poor
kids have to eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But think how much good education there
is wrapped up in the school dinner&mdash;if we
could only get it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie grew grave. Here was this Brown
Mouse actually introducing the subject of the
school&mdash;and he ought to suspect that she was
planning to line him up on this very thing&mdash;if
he wasn&#8217;t a perfect donkey as well as a
dreamer. And he was calmly wading into the
subject as if she were the ex-farm-hand country
teacher, and he was the county superintendent-elect!</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating a dinner like this, mother,&#8221; said
the colonel gallantly, &#8220;is an education in itself&mdash;and
eating some others requires one; but
just how &#8216;larnin&#8217; is wrapped up in the school
lunch is a new one on me, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;in the first place the children
ought to cook their meals as a part of
the school work. Prior to that they ought to
buy the materials. And prior to that they
ought to keep the accounts of the school
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
kitchen. They&#8217;d like to do these things, and
it would help prepare them for life on an intelligent
plane, while they prepared the meals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that looking rather far ahead?&#8221; asked
the county superintendent-elect.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a lot of other things we think far
ahead,&#8221; urged Jim. &#8220;The only reason why
they&#8217;re far off is because we think them so.
It&#8217;s a thought&mdash;and a thought is as near the
moment we think it as it will ever be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s so&mdash;to a wild-eyed reformer,&#8221;
said the colonel. &#8220;But go on. Develop your
thought a little. Have some more dressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, I believe I will,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;And
a little more of the cranberry sauce. No more
turkey, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see the school class that could
prepare this dinner,&#8221; said Mrs. Woodruff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;you&#8217;d be there showing
them how! They&#8217;d get credits in their domestic-economy
course for getting the school dinner&mdash;and
they&#8217;d bring their mothers into it to
help them stand at the head of their classes.
And one detail of girls would cook one week,
and another serve. The setting of the table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
would come in as a study&mdash;flowers, linen and
all that. And when we get a civilized teacher,
table manners!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take on that class,&#8221; said the hired man,
winking at Selma Carlson, the maid, from
somewhere below the salt. &#8220;The way I make
my knife feed my face would be a great help
to the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when the food came on the table,&#8221; Jim
went on, with a smile at his former fellow-laborer,
who had heard most of this before as
a part of the field conversation, &#8220;just think of
the things we could study while eating it. The
literary term for eating a meal is discussing
it&mdash;well, the discussion of a meal under proper
guidance is much more educative than a lecture.
This breast-bone, now,&#8221; said he, referring
to the remains on his plate. &#8220;That&#8217;s physiology.
The cranberry-sauce&mdash;that&#8217;s botany,
and commerce, and soil management&mdash;do you
know, Colonel, that the cranberry must have an
acid soil&mdash;which would kill alfalfa or clover?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read something of it,&#8221; said the colonel,
&#8220;but it didn&#8217;t interest me much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the difference between the types of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
fowl on the table&mdash;that&#8217;s breeding. And the
nutmeg, pepper and cocoanut&mdash;that&#8217;s geography.
And everything on the table runs back
to geography, and comes to us linked to our
lives by dollars and cents&mdash;and they&#8217;re mathematics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have something more than dollars
and cents in life,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;We must have
culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Culture,&#8221; cried Jim, &#8220;is the ability to think
in terms of life&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Jesse James,&#8221; suggested the hired man,
who was a careful student of the life of that
eminent bandit.</p>
<p>There was a storm of laughter at this sally
amidst which Jennie wished she had thought
of something like that. Jim joined in the
laughter at his own expense, but was clearly
suffering from argumentative shock.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best answer I&#8217;ve had on that
point, Pete,&#8221; he said, after the disturbance had
subsided. &#8220;But if the James boys and the
Youngers had had the sort of culture I&#8217;m for,
they would have been successful stock men and
farmers, instead of train-robbers. Take Raymond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Simms, for instance. He had all the
qualifications of a member of the James gang
when he came here. All he needed was a few
exasperated associates of his own sort, and a
convenient railway with undefended trains
running over it. But after a few weeks of real
&#8216;culture&#8217; under a mighty poor teacher, he&#8217;s developing
into the most enthusiastic farmer I
know. That&#8217;s real culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s snowing like everything,&#8221; said Jennie,
who faced the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cut your dinner short,&#8221; said the
colonel to Pete, &#8220;but I think you&#8217;ll find the
cattle ready to come in out of the storm when
you get good and through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll let &#8217;em in now,&#8221; said Pete, by
way of excusing himself. &#8220;I expect to put in
most of the day from now on getting ready to
quit eating. Save some of everything for
me, Selma,&mdash;I&#8217;ll be right back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Pete,&#8221; said Selma.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE MOUSE ESCAPES</h3>
</div>

<p>Jennie played the piano and sang. They
all joined in some simple Christmas songs.
Mrs. Woodruff and Jim&#8217;s mother went into
other parts of the house on research work connected
with their converse on domestic economy.
The colonel withdrew for an inspection
of the live stock on the eve of the threatened
blizzard. And Jim was left alone with Jennie
in the front parlor. After the buzz of conversation,
they seemed to have nothing to say.
Jennie played softly, and looked at nothing, but
scrutinized Jim by means of the eyes which
women have concealed in their back hair.
There was something new in the man&mdash;she
sensed that. He was more confident, more persuasive,
more dynamic. She was used to him
only as a static force.</p>
<p>And Jim felt something new, too. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
felt it growing in him ever since he began his
school work, and knew not the cause of it. The
cause, however, would not have been a mystery
to a wise old yogi who might discover the
same sort of change in one of his young novices.
Jim Irwin had been a sort of ascetic since his
boyhood. He had mortified the flesh by hard
labor in the fields, and by flagellations of the
brain to drive off sleep while he pored over his
books in the attic&mdash;which was often so hot
after a day of summer&#8217;s sun on its low thin
roof, that he was forced to do his reading in
the midmost night. He had looked long on
such women as Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Isabel,
Cressida, Volumnia, Virginia, Evangeline,
Agnes Wickfleld and Fair Rosamond; but on
women in the flesh he had gazed as upon trees
walking. The aforesaid spiritual director, had
this young ascetic been under one, would have
foreseen the effects on the psychology of a stout
fellow of twenty-eight of freedom from the toil
of the fields, and association with a group of
young human beings of both sexes. To the
novice struggling for emancipation from earthly
thoughts, he would have recommended fasting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
and prayer, and perhaps, a hair shirt. Just
what his prescription would have been for a
man in Jim&#8217;s position is, of course, a question.
He would, no doubt, have considered carefully
his patient&#8217;s symptoms. These were very
largely the mental experiences which most boys
pass through in their early twenties, save, perhaps
that, as in a belated season, the transition
from winter to spring was more sudden, and
the contrast more violent. Jim was now thrown
every day into contact with his fellows. He was
no longer a lay monk, but an active member of
a very human group. He was becoming more
of a boy, with the boys, and still more was he
developing into a man with the women. The
budding womanhood of Calista Simms and the
other girls of his school thrilled him as Helen
of Troy or Juliet had never done. This will
not seem very strange to the experienced
reader, but it astonished the unsophisticated
young schoolmaster. The floating hair, the
heaving bosom, the rosebud mouth, the starry
eye, the fragrant breath, the magnetic hand&mdash;all
these disturbed the hitherto sedate mind,
and filled the brief hours he was accustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
to spend in sleep with strange dreams. And
now, as he gazed at Jennie, he was suddenly
aware of the fact that, after all, whenever
these thoughts and dreams took on individuality,
they were only persistent and intensified
continuations of his old dreams of her. They
had always been dormant in him, since the days
they both studied from the same book. He was
quite sure, now, that he had never forgotten
for a moment, that Jennie was the only girl in
the world for him. And possibly he was right
about this. It is perfectly certain, however,
that for years he had not consciously been in
love with her.</p>
<p>Now, however, he arose as from some inner
compulsion, and went to her side. He wished
that he knew enough of music to turn her
sheets for her, but, alas! the notes were meaningless
to him. Still scanning him by means
of her back hair, Jennie knew that in another
moment Jim would lay his hand on her shoulder,
or otherwise advance to personal nearness,
as he had done the night of his ill-starred
speech at the schoolhouse&mdash;and she rose in self-defense.
Self-defense, however, did not seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
to require that he be kept at too great a distance;
so she maneuvered him to the sofa, and
seated him beside her. Now was the time to
line him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems good to have you with us to-day,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;We&#8217;re such old, old friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; repeated Jim, &#8220;old friends .... We
are, aren&#8217;t we, Jennie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I feel sure,&#8221; Jennie went on, &#8220;that this
marks a new era in our friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Jim, after considering the
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! everything is different, now&mdash;and getting
more different all the time. My new work,
and your new work, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to think,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that we
are beginning over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are, we are, indeed! I am quite sure
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;there is no such thing
as a new beginning. Everything joins itself
to something which went before. There isn&#8217;t
any seam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; said Jennie interrogatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our regard for each other,&#8221; Jennie noted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
most pointedly his word &#8220;regard&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;must be
the continuation of the old regard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know what you mean,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>Jim reached over and possessed himself of
her hand. She pulled it from him gently, but
he paid no attention to the little muscular protest,
and examined the hand critically. On the
back of the middle finger he pointed out a scar&mdash;a
very tiny scar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember how you got that?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>Because Jim clung to the hand, their heads
were very close together as she joined in the
examination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t believe I do,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We&mdash;you and I and
Mary Forsythe were playing mumble-peg, and
you put your hand on the grass just as I threw
the knife&mdash;it cut you, and left that scar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember, now!&#8221; said she. &#8220;How such
things come back over the memory. And did
it leave a scar when I pushed you toward the
red-hot stove in the schoolhouse one blizzardy
day, like this, and you peeled the skin off your
wrist where it struck the stove?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look at it,&#8221; said he, baring his long and
bony wrist. &#8220;Right there!&#8221;</p>
<p>And they were off on the trail that leads
back to childhood. They had talked long, and
intimately, when the shadows of the early evening
crept into the corners of the room. He
had carried her across the flooded slew again
after the big rain. They had relived a dozen
moving incidents by flood and field. Jennie
recalled the time when the tornado narrowly
missed the schoolhouse, and frightened everybody
in school nearly to death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody but you, Jim,&#8221; Jennie remembered.
&#8220;You looked out of the window and
told the teacher that the twister was going
north of us, and would kill somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;and when the teacher
asked us to kneel and thank God, you said,
&#8216;Why should we thank God that somebody else
is blowed away?&#8217; She was greatly shocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see to this day,&#8221; Jim asserted, &#8220;what
answer there was to my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the gathering darkness Jim again took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Jennie&#8217;s hand, but this time she deprived him
of it.</p>
<p>He was trembling like a leaf. Let it be remembered
in his favor that this was the only
girl&#8217;s hand he had ever held.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t find any more scars on it,&#8221; she
said soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see how much it has changed since
I stuck the knife in it,&#8221; begged Jim.</p>
<p>Jennie held it up for inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s longer, and slenderer, and whiter, and
even more beautiful,&#8221; said he, &#8220;than the little
hand I cut; but it was then the most beautiful
hand in the world to me&mdash;and still is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must light the lamps,&#8221; said the county
superintendent-elect, rather flustered, it must
be confessed. &#8220;Mama! Where are all the
matches?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woodruff and Mrs. Irwin came in, and
the lamplight reminded Jim&#8217;s mother that the
cow was still to milk, and that the chickens
might need attention. The Woodruff sleigh
came to the door to carry them home; but Jim
desired to breast the storm. He felt that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
needed the conflict. Mrs. Irwin scolded him
for his foolishness, but he strode off into the
whirling drift, throwing back a good-by for
general consumption, and a pathetic smile to
Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as odd as Dick&#8217;s hatband,&#8221; said Mrs.
Woodruff, &#8220;tramping off in a storm like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you line him up?&#8221; asked the colonel
of Jennie.</p>
<p>The young lady started and blushed. She
had forgotten all about the politics of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid I didn&#8217;t, papa,&#8221; she confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those brown mice of Professor Darbishire&#8217;s,&#8221;
said the colonel, &#8220;were the devil and
all to control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie was thinking of this as she dropped
asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard to control!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I wonder.
I wonder, after all, if Jim is not capable of being
easily lined up&mdash;when he sees how foolish
I think he is!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jim? He found himself hard to control
that night. So much so that it was after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
midnight before he had finished work on a
plan for a cooperative creamery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys can be given work in helping to
operate it,&#8221; he wrote on a tablet, &#8220;which, in
connection with the labor performed by the
teacher, will greatly reduce the expense of operation.
A skilled butter-maker, with slender
white hands&#8221;&mdash;but he erased this last clause
and retired.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>FACING TRIAL</h3>
</div>

<p>A distinct sensation ran through the
Woodruff school, but the schoolmaster and
a group of five big boys and three girls engaged
in a very unclasslike conference in the
back of the room were all unconscious of it.
The geography classes had recited, and the language
work was on. Those too small for these
studies were playing a game under the leadership
of Jinnie Simms, who had been promoted
to the position of weed-seed monitor.</p>
<p>The game was forfeits. Each child had been
encouraged to bring some sort of weed from
the winter fields&mdash;preferably one the seed of
which still clung to the dried receptacles&mdash;but
anyhow, a weed. Some pupils had brought
merely empty tassels, some bare stalks, and
some seeds which they had winnowed from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
the grain in their father&#8217;s bins; and with them
they played forfeits. They counted out by the
&#8220;arey, Ira, ickery an&#8217;&#8221; method, and somebody
was &#8220;It.&#8221; Then, in order, they presented to
him a seed, stalk or head of a weed, and if the
one who was It could tell the name of the weed,
the child who brought the specimen became It,
and the name was written on slates or tablets,
and the new It told where the weed or seed was
collected. If any pupil brought in a specimen
the name of which he himself could not correctly
give, he paid a forfeit. If a specimen
was brought in not found in the school cabinet&mdash;which
was coming to contain a considerable
collection&mdash;it was placed there, and the task
allotted to the best penman in the school to
write its proper label. All this caused excitement,
and not a little buzz&mdash;but it ceased when
the county superintendent entered the room.</p>
<p>For it was after the first of January, and
Jennie was visiting the Woodruff school.</p>
<p>The group in the back of the room went on
with its conference, oblivious of the entrance
of Superintendent Jennie. Their work was
rather absorbing, being no more nor less than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the compilation of the figures of a cow census
of the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Altogether,&#8221; said Mary Talcott, &#8220;we have
in the district one hundred and fifty-three
cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t make it that,&#8221; said Raymond Simms.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t get but a hundred and thirty-eight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; said Newton Bronson, &#8220;that
Mary&#8217;s counting in the Bailey herd of Shorthorns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re cows, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; interrogated
Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for this census,&#8221; said Raymond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Mary. &#8220;They&#8217;re the prettiest
cows in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scotch Shorthorns,&#8221; said Newton, &#8220;and run
with their calves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave them out,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and to-morrow,
I want each one to tell in the language
class, in three hundred words or less, whether
there are enough cows in the district to justify
a cooperative creamery, and give the reason.
You&#8217;ll find articles in the farm papers if you
look through the card index. Now, how about
the census in the adjoining districts?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are more than two hundred within
four miles on the roads leading west,&#8221; said a
boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father and I counted up about a hundred
beyond us,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t
get the exact number.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Raymond, &#8220;we could find six
hundred dairy cows in this neighborhood,
within an hour&#8217;s drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six hundred!&#8221; scoffed Newton. &#8220;You&#8217;re
crazy! In an hour&#8217;s drive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean an hour&#8217;s drive each way,&#8221; said
Raymond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we could,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;And after
we find how far we will have to go to get
enough cows, if half of them patronized the
creamery, we&#8217;ll work over the savings the business
would make, if we could get the prices
for butter paid the Wisconsin cooperative
creameries, as compared with what the centralizers
pay us, on a basis of the last six months.
Who&#8217;s in possession of that correspondence
with the Wisconsin creameries?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; said Raymond. &#8220;I&#8217;m hectographing
a lot of arithmetic problems from it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Irwin!&#8221; It was the superintendent
who spoke.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s brain whirled little prismatic clouds
before his vision, as he rose and shook Jennie&#8217;s
extended hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me give you a chair,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you!&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just
make myself at home. I know my way about
in this schoolhouse, you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled at the children, and went about
looking at their work&mdash;which was not noticeably
disturbed, by reason of the fact that visitors
were much more frequent now than ever
before, and were no rarity. Certainly, Jennie
Woodruff was no novelty, since they had known
her all their lives. Most of the embarrassment
was Jim&#8217;s. He rose to the occasion, however,
went through the routine of the closing day,
and dismissed the flock, not omitting making
an engagement with a group of boys for that
evening to come back and work on the formalin
treatment for smut in seed grains, and the
blue-vitriol treatment for seed potatoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t time for these things,&#8221; said he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
to the county superintendent, &#8220;in the regular
class work&mdash;and it&#8217;s getting time to take them
up if we are to clean out the smut in next year&#8217;s
crop.&#8221;</p>
<p>They repeated Whittier&#8217;s <i>Corn Song</i> in
concert, and school was out.</p>
<p>Alone with her in the old schoolhouse, Jim
confronted Jennie in the flesh. She felt a sense
of his agitation, but if she had known the
power of it, she would have been astonished.
Since that Christmas afternoon when she had
undertaken to follow Mr. Peterson&#8217;s advice and
line Yim Irwin up, Jim had gone through an
inward transformation. He had passed from
a late, cold, backward sexual spring, into a
warm June of the spirit, in which he had
walked amid roses and lilies with Jennie. He
was in love with her. He knew how insane it
was, how much less than nothing had taken
place in his circumstances to justify the hope
that he could ever emerge from the state in
which she would not say &#8220;Humph!&#8221; at the
thought that he could marry her or any one
else. Yet, he had made up his mind that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
would marry Jennie Woodruff .... She ought
never have tried to line him up. She knew not
what she did.</p>
<p>He saw her through clouds of rose and pink;
but she looked at him as at a foolish man who
was making trouble for her, chasing rainbows
at her expense, and deeply vexing her. She
was in a cold official frame of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said she, &#8220;do you know that you are
facing trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;is the natural condition
of a man in my state of mind. But it is
going to be a delicious sort of tribulation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; she replied
in perfect honesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; replied
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said pleadingly, &#8220;I want you to
give up this sort of teaching. Can&#8217;t you see
it&#8217;s all wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Jim, in much the manner
of a man who has been stabbed by his sweetheart.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s the
only sort I can do. What do you see wrong
in it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can see some very wonderful things
in it,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;but it can&#8217;t be done in the
Woodruff District. It may be correct in theory,
but it won&#8217;t work in practise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when a thing won&#8217;t work,
it isn&#8217;t correct in theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Jim,&#8221; said she, &#8220;why do you
keep on with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It works,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Anything that&#8217;s correct
in theory will work. If the theory seems
correct, and yet won&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s because something
is wrong in an unsuspected way with the
theory. But my theory is correct, and it
works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the district is against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are the district?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The school board are against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The school board elected me after listening
to an explanation of my theories as to the new
sort of rural school in which I believe. I assume
that they commissioned me to carry out
my ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim!&#8221; cried Jennie. &#8220;That&#8217;s sophistry!
They all voted for you so you wouldn&#8217;t be without
support. Each wanted you to have just one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
vote. Nobody wanted you elected. They were
all surprised. You know that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They stood by and saw the contract signed,&#8221;
said Jim, &#8220;and&mdash;yes, Jennie, I <i>am</i> dealing in
sophistry! I got the school by a sort of shell-game,
which the board worked on themselves.
But that doesn&#8217;t prove that the district is
against me. I believe the people are for me,
now, Jennie. I really do!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie rose and walked to the rear of the
room and back, twice. When she spoke, there
was decision in her tone&mdash;and Jim felt that it
was hostile decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an officer,&#8221; she said rather grandly, &#8220;my
relations with the district are with the school
board on the one hand, and with your competency
as a teacher on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it come to that?&#8221; asked Jim. &#8220;Well, I
have rather expected it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was weary. The Lincolnian droop
in his great, sad, mournful mouth accentuated
the resemblance to the martyr president. Possibly
his feelings were not entirely different
from those experienced by Lincoln at some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
crises of doubt, misunderstanding and depression.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t change your methods,&#8221; said
Jennie, &#8220;I suggest that you resign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that changing
my methods would appease the men who feel
that they are made laughing-stocks by having
elected me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie was silent; for she knew that the
school board meant to pursue their policy of
getting rid of the accidental incumbent regardless
of his methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would never call off their dogs,&#8221; said
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;But your methods would make a great difference
with my decision,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you to be called upon to decide?&#8221; asked
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;A formal complaint against you for incompetency,&#8221;
she replied, &#8220;has been lodged in my
office, signed by the three directors. I shall
be obliged to take notice of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you think,&#8221; queried Jim, &#8220;that my
abandonment of the things in which I believe
in the face of this attack would prove to your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
mind that I am competent? Or would it show
me incompetent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Jennie was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that we&#8217;ll have to stand
or fall on things as they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you refuse to resign?&#8221; asked Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think it&#8217;s not worth while to
try any longer,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;And yet, I believe
that in my way I&#8217;m working on the question
which must be solved if this nation is to stand&mdash;the
question of making the farm and farm life
what they should be and may well be. At this
moment, I feel like surrendering&mdash;for your
sake more than mine; but I&#8217;ll have to think
about it. Suppose I refuse to resign?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie had drawn on her gloves, and stood
ready for departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you resign before the twenty-fifth,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;I shall hear the petition for your removal
on that date. You will be allowed to
be present and answer the charges against
you. The charges are incompetency. I bid you
good evening!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Incompetency!&#8221; The disgraceful word,
representing everything he had always despised,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
rang through Jim&#8217;s mind as he walked
home. He could think of nothing else as he sat
at the simple supper which he could scarcely
taste. Incompetent! Well, had he not always
been incompetent, except in the use of his
muscles? Had he not always been a dreamer?
Were not all his dreams as foreign to life
and common sense as the Milky Way
from the earth? What reason was there for
thinking that this crusade of his for better
schools had any sounder foundation than his
dream of being president, or a great painter,
or a poet or novelist or philosopher? He was
just a hayseed, a rube, a misfit, as odd as Dick&#8217;s
hatband, an off ox. He <i>was</i> incompetent. He
picked up a pen, and began writing. He wrote,
&#8220;To the Honorable the Board of Education of
the Independent District of &mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And he
heard a tap at the door. His mother admitted
Colonel Woodruff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jim,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Colonel,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Take
a chair, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the colonel. &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d
see if you and the boys at the schoolhouse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
can&#8217;t tell me something about the smut in my
wheat. I heard you were going to work on that
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten!&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wondered if you hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the colonel,
&#8220;and so I came by for you. I was waiting up
the road. Come on, and ride up with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colonel had always been friendly, but
there was a new note in his manner to-night.
He was almost deferential. If he had been
talking to Senator Cummins or the president
of the state university, his tone could not have
been more courteous, more careful to preserve
the amenities due from man to man. He
worked with the class on the problem of smut.
He offered to aid the boys in every possible
way in their campaign against scab in potatoes.
He suggested some tests which would show the
real value of the treatment. The boys were in
a glow of pride at this cooperation with Colonel
Woodruff. This was real work! Jim and the
colonel went away together. It had been a
great evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;can these kids
spell?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean these boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that they can outspell
any school about here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;How are they
about reading aloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than they were when I took hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about arithmetic and the other
branches? Have you sort of kept them up to
the course of study?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have carried them in a course parallel to
the text-books,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and covering the
same ground. But it has been vocational work,
you know&mdash;related to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;if I were you, I&#8217;d
put them over a rapid review of the text-books
for a few days&mdash;say between now and the
twenty-fifth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing&mdash;just to please me .... And
say, Jim, I glanced over a communication
you have started to the more or less Honorable
Board of Education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t finish it .... And say, Jim,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
I think I&#8217;ll give myself the luxury of being a
wild-eyed reformer for once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jim, dazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you think, Jim, that you&#8217;ve got no
friends, just remember that I&#8217;m for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll show them they&#8217;re in a horse
race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see ...&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not supposed to see,&#8221; said the
colonel, &#8220;but you can bet that we&#8217;ll be with
them at the finish; and, by thunder! while
they&#8217;re getting a full meal, we&#8217;ll get at least
a lunch. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jennie says,&#8221; began Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what she says,&#8221; said the
colonel. &#8220;She&#8217;s acting according to her judgment,
and her lights and other organs of perception,
and I don&#8217;t think it fittin&#8217; that her
father should try to influence her official conduct.
But you go on and review them common
branches, and keep your nerve. I haven&#8217;t felt
so much like a scrap since the day we stormed
Lookout Mountain. I kinder like being a wild-eyed
reformer, Jim.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>FAME OR NOTORIETY</h3>
</div>

<p>The office of county superintendent was, as
a matter of course, the least desirable room
of the court-house. I say &#8220;room&#8221; advisedly,
because it consisted of a single chamber of
moderate size, provided with office furniture of
the minimum quantity and maximum age. It
opened off the central hall at the upper end of
the stairway which led to the court room, and
when court was in session, served the extraordinary
needs of justice as a jury room. At
such times the county superintendent&#8217;s desk
was removed to the hall, where it stood in a
noisy and confusing but very democratic publicity.
Superintendent Jennie might have
anticipated the time when, during the March
term, offenders passing from the county jail
in the basement to arraignment at the bar of
justice might be able to peek over her shoulders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
and criticize her method of treating
examination papers. On the twenty-fifth of
February, however, this experience lurked
unsuspected in her official future.</p>
<p>Poor Jennie! She anticipated nothing more
than the appearance of Messrs. Bronson,
Peterson and Bonner in her office to confront
Jim Irwin on certain questions of fact relating
to Jim&#8217;s competency to hold a teacher&#8217;s
certificate. The time appointed was ten
o&#8217;clock. At nine forty-five Cornelius Bonner
and his wife entered the office, and took twenty-five
per cent. of the chairs therein. At nine
fifty Jim Irwin came in, haggard, weather-beaten
and seedy as ever, and looked as if he
had neither eaten nor slept since his sweetheart
stabbed him. At nine fifty-five Haakon Peterson
and Ezra Bronson came in, accompanied by
Wilbur Smythe, attorney-at-law, who carried
under his arm a code of Iowa, a compilation
of the school laws of the state, and <i>Throop on
Public Officers</i>. At nine fifty-six, therefore, the
crowd in Jennie&#8217;s office exceeded its seating
capacity, and Jennie was in a flutter as the
realization dawned upon her that this promised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
to be a bigger and more public affair than she
had anticipated. At nine fifty-nine Raymond
Simms opened the office door and there filed
in enough children, large and small, some of
them accompanied by their parents, and all
belonging to the Woodruff school, to fill completely
the interstices of the corners and angles
of the room and between the legs of the grownups.
In addition there remained an overflow
meeting in the hall, under the command of that
distinguished military gentleman, Colonel Albert
Woodruff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Bill, come here!&#8221; said the colonel,
crooking his finger at the deputy sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got here, Al!&#8221; said Bill, coming
up the stairs, puffing. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t it a little early
for Sunday-school picnics?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a school fight in our district,&#8221; said
the colonel. &#8220;It&#8217;s Jennie&#8217;s baptism of fire, I
reckon ... and say, you&#8217;re not using the
court room, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why not just slip around, then,&#8221; said
the colonel, &#8220;and tell Jennie she&#8217;d better adjourn
to the big room.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>Which suggestion was acted upon instanter
by Deputy Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jennie to the
courteous deputy sheriff. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want all this
publicity, and I don&#8217;t want to go into the court
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly see,&#8221; said Deputy Bill, &#8220;how you
can avoid it. These people seem to have business
with you, and they can&#8217;t get into your
office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they have no business with me,&#8221; said
Jennie. &#8220;It&#8217;s mere curiosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Wilbur Smythe, who could see no
particular point in restricted publicity, said,
&#8220;Madame County Superintendent, this hearing
certainly is public or quasi-public. Your office
is a public one, and while the right to attend
this hearing may not possibly be a universal
one, it surely is one belonging to every citizen
and taxpayer of the county, and if the taxpayer,
<i>qua</i> taxpayer, then certainly <i>a fortiori</i> to the
members of the Woodruff school and residents
of that district.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie quailed. &#8220;All right, all right!&#8221; said
she. &#8220;But, shall I have to sit on the bench!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will find it by far the most convenient
place,&#8221; said Deputy Bill.</p>
<p>Was this the life to which public office had
brought her? Was it for this that she had
bartered her independence&mdash;for this and the
musty office, the stupid examination papers,
and the interminable visiting of schools, knowing
that such supervision as she could give
was practically worthless? Jim had said to her
that he had never heard of such a thing as a
good county superintendent of schools, and she
had thought him queer. And now, here was she,
called upon to pass on the competency of the
man who had always been her superior in
everything that constitutes mental ability; and
to make the thing more a matter for the laughter
of the gods, she was perched on the judicial
bench, which Deputy Bill had dusted off for
her, tipping a wink to the assemblage while
doing it. He expected to be a candidate for
sheriff, one of these days, and was pleasing
the crowd. And that crowd! To Jennie it
was appalling. The school board under the
lead of Wilbur Smythe took seats inside the
railing which on court days divided the audience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
from the lawyers and litigants. Jim
Irwin, who had never been in a court room before,
herded with the crowd, obeying the attraction
of sympathy, but to Jennie, seated on
the bench, he, like other persons in the auditorium,
was a mere blurry outline with a knob
of a head on its top.</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t call the gathering to order. She
had no idea as to the proper procedure. She
sat there while the people gathered, stood about
whispering and talking under their breaths,
and finally became silent, all their eyes fixed
on her, as she wished that the office of county
superintendent had been abolished in the days
of her parents&#8217; infancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;May it please the court,&#8221; said Wilbur
Smythe, standing before the bar. &#8220;Or, Madame
County Superintendent, I should say ...&#8221;</p>
<p>A titter ran through the room, and a flush
of temper tinted Jennie&#8217;s face. They were
laughing at her! She wouldn&#8217;t be a spectacle
any longer! So she rose, and handed down
her first and last decision from the bench&mdash;a
rather good one, I think.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Smythe,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I feel very ill at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
ease up here, and I&#8217;m going to get down among
the people. It&#8217;s the only way I have of getting
the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She descended from the bench, shook hands
with everybody near her, and sat down by the
attorney&#8217;s table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said she, &#8220;this is no formal proceeding
and we will dispense with red tape. If
we don&#8217;t, I shall get all tangled up in it.
Where&#8217;s Mr. Irwin? Please come in here,
Jim. Now, I know there&#8217;s some feeling in these
things&mdash;there always seems to be; but I have
none. So I&#8217;ll just hear why Mr. Bronson, Mr.
Peterson and Mr. Bonner think that Mr. James
E. Irwin isn&#8217;t competent to hold a certificate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie was able to smile at them now, and
everybody felt more at ease, save Jim Irwin,
the members of the board and Wilbur Smythe.
That individual arose, and talked down at Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appear for the proponents here,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and I desire to suggest certain principles of
procedure which I take it belong indisputably
to the conduct of this hearing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a lawyer?&#8221; asked the county
superintendent of the respondent.</p>
<p>&#8220;A what?&#8221; exclaimed Jim. &#8220;Nobody here
has a lawyer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you call Wilbur Smythe?&#8221;
queried Newton Bronson from the midst of the
crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t lawyer enough to hurt!&#8221; said the
thing which the dramatists call A Voice.</p>
<p>There was a little tempest of laughter at
Wilbur Smythe&#8217;s expense, which was quelled
by Jennie&#8217;s rapping on the table. She was beginning
to feel the mouth of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no way of retaining a lawyer,&#8221; said
Jim, on whom the truth had gradually dawned.
&#8220;If a lawyer is necessary, I am without protection&mdash;but
it never occurred to me ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in the school laws, as I
remember them,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;giving the parties
any right to be represented by counsel. If
there is, Mr. Smythe will please set me right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused for Mr. Smythe&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing which expressly gives that
privilege,&#8221; said Mr. Smythe, &#8220;but the right to
the benefit of skilled advisers is a universal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
one. It can not be questioned. And in opening
this case for my clients, I desire to call your
honor&#8217;s attention&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may advise your clients all you please,&#8221;
said Jennie, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not going to waste time
in listening to speeches, or having a lot of lawyers
examine witnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest,&#8221; said Mr. Smythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you may file your protest in writing,&#8221;
said Jennie. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to talk this matter
over with these old friends and neighbors of
mine. I don&#8217;t want you dipping into it, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie&#8217;s voice was rising toward the scream-line,
and Mr. Smythe recognized the hand of
fate. One may argue with a cantankerous judge,
but the woman, who like necessity, knows no
law, and who is smothering in a flood of perplexities,
is beyond reason. Moreover, Jennie
dimly saw that what she was doing had the
approval of the crowd, and it solved the problem
of procedure.</p>
<p>There was a little wrangling, and a little
protest from Con Bonner, but Jennie ruled with
a rod of iron, and adhered to her ruling. When
the hearing was resumed after the noon recess,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
the crowd was larger than ever, but the proceedings
consisted mainly in a conference of
the principals grouped about Jennie at the big
lawyers&#8217; table. They were talking about the
methods adopted by Jim in his conduct of the
Woodruff school&mdash;just talking. The only new
thing was the presence of a couple of newspaper
men, who had queried Chicago papers
on the story, and been given orders for a certain
number of words on the case of the farm-hand
schoolmaster on trial before his old sweetheart
for certain weird things he had done in the
home school in which they had once been classmates.
The fact that the old school-sweetheart
had kicked a lawyer out of the case was not
overlooked by the gentlemen of the fourth
estate. It helped to make it a &#8220;good story.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time at which gathering darkness
made it necessary for the bailiff to light the
lamps, the parties had agreed on the facts.
Jim admitted most of the allegations. He had
practically ignored the text-books. He had
burned the district fuel and worn out the district
furniture early and late, and on Saturdays.
He had introduced domestic economy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
and manual training, to some extent, by sending
the boys to the workshops and the girls to
the kitchens and sewing-rooms of the farmers
who allowed those privileges. He had used
up a great deal of time in studying farm conditions.
He had induced the boys to test the
cows of the district for butter-fat yield. He
was studying the matter of a cooperative
creamery. He hoped to have a blacksmith
shop on the schoolhouse grounds sometime,
where the boys could learn metal working by
repairing the farm machinery, and shoeing the
farm horses. He hoped to install a cooperative
laundry in connection with the creamery. He
hoped to see a building sometime, with an auditorium
where the people would meet often for
moving picture shows, lectures and the like,
and he expected that most of the descriptions
of foreign lands, industrial operations, wild
animals&mdash;in short, everything that people
should learn about by seeing, rather than reading&mdash;would
be taught the children by moving
pictures accompanied by lectures. He hoped
to open to the boys and girls the wonders of
the universe which are touched by the work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
on the farm. He hoped to make good and contented
farmers of them, able to get the most
out of the soil, to sell what they produced to
the best advantage, and at the same time to
keep up the fertility of the soil itself. And
he hoped to teach the girls in such a way that
they would be good and contented farmers&#8217;
wives. He even had in mind as a part of the
schoolhouse the Woodruff District would one
day build, an apartment in which the mothers
of the neighborhood would leave their babies
when they went to town, so that the girls could
learn the care of infants.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I say,&#8221; interposed Con Bonner, &#8220;that
we can rest our case right here. If that ain&#8217;t
the limit, I don&#8217;t know what is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;do you desire to rest
your case right here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bonner made no reply to this, and Jennie
turned to Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Irwin,&#8221; said she, &#8220;while you have
been following out these very interesting and
original methods, what have you done in the
way of teaching the things called for by the
course of study?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is the course of study?&#8221; queried Jim.
&#8220;Is it anything more than an outline of the
mental march the pupils are ordered to make?
Take reading: why does it give the children
any greater mastery of the printed page to
read about Casabianca on the burning deck,
than about the cause of the firing of corn by hot
weather? And how can they be given better
command of language than by writing about
things they have found out in relation to some
of the sciences which are laid under contribution
by farming? Everything they do runs
into numbers, and we do more arithmetic than
the course requires. There isn&#8217;t any branch
of study&mdash;not even poetry and art and music&mdash;that
isn&#8217;t touched by life. If there is we haven&#8217;t
time for it in the common schools. We work
out from life to everything in the course of
study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to assert,&#8221; queried Jennie,
&#8220;that while you have been doing all this work
which was never contemplated by those who
have made up the course of study, that you
haven&#8217;t neglected anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that I&#8217;m willing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
stand or fall on an examination of these children
in the very text-books we are accused of
neglecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie looked steadily at Jim for a full
minute, and at the clock. It was nearly time
for adjournment.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many pupils of the Woodruff school
are here?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;All rise, please!&#8221;</p>
<p>A mass of the audience, in the midst of which
sat Jennie&#8217;s father, rose at the request.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;I should say we had a
quorum, anyhow! How many will come back
to-morrow morning at nine o&#8217;clock, and bring
your school-books? Please lift hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nearly every hand went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Mr. Irwin,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;will you
have the school records, so we may be able to
ascertain the proper standing of these pupils?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;we&#8217;ll adjourn until
nine o&#8217;clock. I hope to see every one here.
We&#8217;ll have school here to-morrow. And, Mr.
Irwin, please remember that you state that
you&#8217;ll stand or fall on the mastery by these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
pupils of the text-books they are supposed to
have neglected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the mastery of the text,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;But their ability to do the work the text is
supposed to fit them for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but that&#8217;s
fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mrs. Haakon Peterson, &#8220;we
don&#8217;t want our children brought up to be yust
farmers. Suppose we move to town&mdash;where
does the culture come in?&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The Chicago papers had a news item which
covered the result of the examinations; but
the great sensation of the Woodruff District
lay in the Sunday feature carried by one of
them.</p>
<p>It had a picture of Jim Irwin, and one of
Jennie Woodruff&mdash;the latter authentic, and
the former gleaned from the morgue, and apparently
the portrait of a lumber-jack. There
was also a very free treatment by the cartoonist
of Mr. Simms carrying a rifle with the
intention of shooting up the school board in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
case the decision went against the schoolmaster.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;When it became known,&#8221; said the news
story, &#8220;that the schoolmaster had bet his job
on the proficiency of his school in studies supposed
and alleged to have been studiously
neglected, the excitement rose to fever heat.
Local sports bet freely on the result, the odds
being eight to five on General Proficiency
against the field. The field was Jim Irwin and
his school. And the way those rural kids rose
in their might and ate up the text-books was
simply scandalous. There was a good deal of
nervousness on the part of some of the small
starters, and some bursts of tears at excusable
failures. But when the fight was over, and
the dead and wounded cared for, the school
board and the county superintendent were
forced to admit that they wished the average
school could do as well under a similar test.</p>
<p>&#8220;The local Mr. Dooley is Cornelius Bonner,
a member of the &#8216;board.&#8217; When asked for a
statement of his views after the county superintendent
had decided that her old sweetheart
was to be allowed the priceless boon of earning
forty dollars a month during the remainder
of his contract, Mr. Bonner said, &#8216;Aside from
being licked, we&#8217;re all right. But we&#8217;ll get this
guy yet, don&#8217;t fall down and fergit that!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The examinations tind to show,&#8217; said Mr.
Bonner, when asked for his opinion on the result,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
&#8216;that in or-r-rder to larn anything you
shud shtudy somethin&#8217; ilse. But we&#8217;ll git this
guy yit!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Colonel Woodruff, as they rode
home together, &#8220;the next heat is the school
election. We&#8217;ve got to control that board next
year&mdash;and we&#8217;ve got to do it by electing one
out of three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a possibility?&#8221; asked Jim. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
we sure to be defeated at last? Shouldn&#8217;t I quit
at the end of my contract? All I ever hoped for
was to be allowed to fulfill that. And is it worth
the fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only possible,&#8221; replied the colonel,
&#8220;but probable. As for being worth while&mdash;why,
this thing is too big to drop. I&#8217;m just
beginning to understand what you&#8217;re driving
at. And I like being a wild-eyed reformer more
and more.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE COLONEL TAKES THE FIELD</h3>
</div>

<p>Every Iowa county has its Farmers&#8217;
Institute. Usually it is held in the county
seat, and is a gathering of farmers for the
ostensible purpose of listening to improving
discussions and addresses both instructive and
entertaining. Really, in most cases, the
farmers&#8217; institutes have been occasions for the
cultivation of relations between a few of the
exceptional farmers and their city friends and
with one another. Seldom is anything done
which leads to any better selling methods for
the farmers, any organization looking to cooperative
effort, or anything else that an agricultural
economist from Ireland, Germany or
Denmark would suggest as the sort of action
which the American farmer must take if he is
to make the most of his life and labor.</p>
<p>The Woodruff District was interested in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
institute however, because of the fact that a
rural-school exhibit was one of its features that
year, and that Colonel Woodruff had secured
an urgent invitation to the school to take part
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got something new out in our district
school,&#8221; said he to the president of the institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I hear,&#8221; said the president&mdash;&#8220;mostly a
fight, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something more,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ll persuade our school to make an exhibit
of real rural work in a real rural school, I&#8217;ll
promise you something worth seeing and discussing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such exhibits are now so common that it is
not worth while for us to describe it; but then,
the sight of a class of children testing and
weighing milk, examining grains for viability
and foul seeds, planning crop rotations, judging
grains and live stock was so new in that county
as to be the real sensation of the institute.</p>
<p>Two persons were a good deal embarrassed
by the success of the exhibit. One was the
county superintendent, who was constantly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
receipt of undeserved compliments upon her
wisdom in fostering really &#8220;practical work in
the schools.&#8221; The other was Jim Irwin, who
was becoming famous, and who felt he had
done nothing to deserve fame. Professor
Withers, an extension lecturer from Ames, took
Jim to dinner at the best hotel in the town, for
the purpose of talking over with him the needs
of the rural schools. Jim was in agony. The
colored waiter fussed about trying to keep Jim
in the beaten track of hotel manners, restored
to him the napkin which Jim failed to use,
and juggled back into place the silverware
which Jim misappropriated to alien and unusual
uses. But, when the meal had progressed
to the stage of conversation, the waiter noticed
that gradually the uncouth farmer became
master of the situation, and the well-groomed
college professor the interested listener.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to come down to our farmers&#8217;
week next year, and tell us about these things,&#8221;
said he to Jim. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s brain reeled. He go to a gathering of
real educators and tell his crude notions! How
could he get the money for his expenses? But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
he had that gameness which goes with supreme
confidence in the thing dealt with.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Ames man, &#8220;There&#8217;s
a small honorarium attached, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim was staggered. What was an honorarium?
He tried to remember what an honorarium
is, and could get no further than the
thought that it is in some way connected with
the Latin root of &#8220;honor.&#8221; Was he obliged to
pay an honorarium for the chance to speak
before the college gathering? Well, he&#8217;d save
money and pay it. The professor must be able
to understand that it couldn&#8217;t be expected that
a country school-teacher would be able to pay
much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll try to take care of the honorarium,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor laughed. It was the first joke
the gangling innovator had perpetrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t bother you to take care of it,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;but if you&#8217;re not too extravagant it will
pay you your expenses and give you a few dollars
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim breathed more freely. An honorarium
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
was paid to the person receiving the honor,
then. What a relief!</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to
come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s consider that settled,&#8221; said the
professor. &#8220;And now I must be going back to
the opera-house. My talk on soil sickness comes
next. I tell you, the winter wheat crop has
been&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jim was not able to think much of the
winter wheat problem as they went back to
the auditorium. He was worth putting on the
program at a state meeting! He was worth
the appreciation of a college professor, trained
to think on the very matters Jim had been
so long mulling over in isolation and blindness!
He was actually worth paying for his
thoughts.</p>
<p>Calista Simms thought she saw something
shining and saint-like about the homely face
of her teacher as he came to her at her post
in the room in which the school exhibit was
held. Calista was in charge of the little children
whose work was to be demonstrated that
day, and was in a state of exaltation to which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
her starved being had hitherto been a stranger.
Perhaps there was something similar in her
condition of fervent happiness to that of Jim.
She, too, was doing something outside the
sordid life of the Simms cabin. She yearned
over the children in her care, and would have
been glad to die for them&mdash;and besides was not
Newton Bronson in charge of the corn exhibit,
and a member of the corn-judging team? To
the eyes of the town girls who passed about
among the exhibits, she was poorly dressed;
but if they could have seen the clothes she
had worn on that evening when Jim Irwin
first called at their cabin and failed to give a
whoop from the big road, they could perhaps
have understood the sense of wellbeing and
happiness in Calista&#8217;s soul at the feeling of her
whole clean underclothes, her neat, if cheap,
dress, and the &#8220;boughten&#8221; cloak she wore&mdash;and
any of them, even without knowledge of this,
might have understood Calista&#8217;s joy at the
knowledge that Newton Bronson&#8217;s eyes were
on her from his station by the big pillar, no
matter how many town girls filed by. For
therein they would have been in a realm of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the passions quite universal in its appeal to the
feminine soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Calista!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;How are you
enjoying it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Calista, and drew a long, long
breath. &#8220;Ah&#8217;m enjoying myse&#8217;f right much,
Mr. Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any of the home folks coming in to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, seh,&#8221; answered Calista. &#8220;All the
school board have stopped by this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim looked about him. He wished he could
see and shake hands with his enemies, Bronson,
Peterson and Bonner: and if he could tell them
of his success with Professor Withers of the
State Agricultural College, perhaps they would
feel differently toward him. There they were
now, over in a corner, with their heads together.
Perhaps they were agreeing among
themselves that he was right in his school
methods, and they wrong. He went toward
them, his face still beaming with that radiance
which had shone so plainly to the eyes of
Calista Simms, but they saw in it only a grin
of exultation over his defeat of them at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
hearing before Jennie Woodruff. When Jim
had drawn so close as almost to call for the
extended hand, he felt the repulsion of their
attitudes and sheered off on some pretended
errand to a dark corner across the room.</p>
<p>They resumed their talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Dimocrat,&#8221; said Con Bonner, &#8220;and you
fellers is Republicans, and we&#8217;ve fought each
other about who we was to hire for teacher;
but when it comes to electing my successor, I
think we shouldn&#8217;t divide on party lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fight about the teacher,&#8221; said Haakon
Peterson, &#8220;is a t&#8217;ing of the past. All our candidates
got odder yobs now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ezra Bronson. &#8220;Prue Foster
wouldn&#8217;t take our school now if she could
get it&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And as I was sayin&#8217;,&#8221; went on Bonner, &#8220;I
want to get this guy, Jim Irwin. An&#8217; bein&#8217;
the cause of his gittin&#8217; the school, I&#8217;d like to be
on the board to kick him off; but if you fellers
would like to have some one else, I won&#8217;t run,
and if the right feller is named, I&#8217;ll line up
what friends I got for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&#8220;You got no friend can git as many wotes as
you can,&#8221; said Peterson. &#8220;I tank you better
run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What say, Ez?&#8221; asked Bonner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me all right,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;I guess
we three have had our fight out and understand
each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; returned Bonner, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the
office again. Let&#8217;s not start too soon, but say
we begin about a week from Sunday to line up
our friends, to go to the school election and
vote kind of unanimous-like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me,&#8221; said Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wery well,&#8221; said Peterson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way Colonel Woodruff acts,&#8221;
said Bonner. &#8220;He rounded up that gang of
kids that shot us all to pieces at that hearing,
didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tank not,&#8221; replied Peterson. &#8220;I tank he
was yust interested in how Yennie managed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked mighty like he was managin&#8217; the
demonstration,&#8221; said Bonner. &#8220;What d&#8217;ye
think, Ez?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too small a matter for the colonel to monkey
with,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;I reckon he was just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
interested in Jennie&#8217;s dilemmer. It ain&#8217;t reasonable
that Colonel Woodruff after the p&#8217;litical
career he&#8217;s had would mix up in school district
politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bonner, &#8220;he seems to take a lot
of interest in this exhibition here. I think
we&#8217;d better watch the colonel. That decision
of Jennie&#8217;s might have been because she&#8217;s stuck
on Jim Irwin, or because she takes a lot of
notice of what her father says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or she might have thought the decision was
right,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;Some people do, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; scoffed Bonner. &#8220;In a pig&#8217;s wrist!
I tell you that decision was crooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vell,&#8221; said Haakon Peterson, &#8220;talk of
crookedness wit&#8217; Yennie Woodruff don&#8217;t get
wery fur wit&#8217; me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean anything bad, Haakon,&#8221;
replied Bonner, &#8220;but it wasn&#8217;t an all-right decision.
I think she&#8217;s stuck on the guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The caucus broke up after making sure that
the three members of the school board would
be as one man in maintaining a hostile front
to Jim Irwin and his tenure of office. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
looked rather like a foregone conclusion, in a
little district wherein there were scarcely
twenty-five votes. The three members of the
board with their immediate friends and dependents
could muster two or three ballots
each&mdash;and who was there to oppose them? Who
wanted to be school director? It was a post
of no profit, little honor and much vexation.
And yet, there are always men to be found
who covet such places. Curiously there are always
those who covet them for no ascertainable
reason, for often they are men who have no
theory of education to further, and no fondness
for affairs of the intellect. In the Woodruff
District, however, the incumbents saw no candidate
in view who could be expected to stand
up against the rather redoubtable Con Bonner.
Jim&#8217;s hold upon his work seemed fairly secure
for the term of his contract, since Jennie had
decided that he was competent; and after that
he himself had no plans. He could not expect
to be retained by the men who had so bitterly
attacked him. Perhaps the publicity of his
Ames address would get him another place with
a sufficient stipend so that he could support his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
mother without the aid of the little garden, the
cows and the fowls&mdash;and perhaps he would ask
Colonel Woodruff to take him back as a farm-hand.
These thoughts thronged his mind as
he stood apart and alone after his rebuff by
the caucusing members of the school board.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said a voice over against the
cooking exhibit, &#8220;what there is in this to
set people talking? Buttonholes! Cookies!
Humph!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Bonner who had clearly come
to scoff. With her was Mrs. Bronson, whose
attitude was that of a person torn between
conflicting influences. Her husband had indicated
to the crafty Bonner and the subtle Peterson
that while he was still loyal to the school
board, and hence perforce opposed to Jim
Irwin, and resentful to the decision of the
county superintendent, his adhesion to the institutions
of the Woodruff District as handed
down by the fathers was not quite of the
thick-and-thin type. For he had suggested that
Jennie might have been sincere in rendering
her decision, and that some people agreed with
her: so Mrs. Bronson, while consorting with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the censorious Mrs. Bonner evinced restiveness
when the school and its work was condemned.
Was not her Newton in charge of a part of
this show! Had he not taken great interest
in the project? Was he not an open and defiant
champion of Jim Irwin, and a constant
and enthusiastic attendant upon, not only his
classes, but a variety of evening and Saturday
affairs at which the children studied arithmetic,
grammar, geography, writing and spelling, by
working on cows, pigs, chickens, grains,
grasses, soils and weeds? And had not Newton
become a better boy&mdash;a wonderfully better
boy? Mrs. Bronson&#8217;s heart was filled with resentment
that she also could not be enrolled
among Jim Irwin&#8217;s supporters. And when
Mrs. Bonner sneered at the buttonholes and
cookies, Mrs. Bronson, knowing how the little
fingers had puzzled themselves over the one,
and young faces had become floury and red
over the other, flared up a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said she, &#8220;anything to
laugh at when the young girls do the best they
can to make themselves capable housekeepers.
I&#8217;d like to help them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
She turned to Mrs. Bonner as if to add &#8220;If
this be treason, make the most of it!&#8221; but
that lady was far too good a diplomat to be
cornered in the same enclosure with a rupture
of relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite right, too,&#8221; said she, &#8220;in the
proper place, and at the proper time. The
little things ought to be helped by every real
woman&mdash;of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; repeated Mrs. Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;At home, now, and by their mothers,&#8221; added
Mrs. Bonner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Bronson, &#8220;take them
Simms girls, now. They have to have help
outside their home if they are ever going to
be like other folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Bonner, &#8220;and a lot more
help than a farm-hand can give &#8217;em in school.
Pretty poor trash, they, and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if there was a lot we don&#8217;t know about why
they come north.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; replied Mrs. Bronson, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know as it&#8217;s any of my business so long as
they behave themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Bonner felt the situation getting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
out of hand, and again she returned to
the task of keeping Mrs. Bronson in alignment
with the forces of accepted Woodruff District
conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it some of our business?&#8221; she
queried. &#8220;I wonder now! By the way Newtie
keeps his eye on that Simms girl, I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if it might turn out your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; scoffed Mrs. Bronson. &#8220;Puppy
love!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how far it&#8217;ll go,&#8221; persisted
Mrs. Bonner. &#8220;I tell you these schools are
getting to be nothing more than sparkin&#8217;
bees, from the county superintendent down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe,&#8221; said Mrs. Bronson, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t see sparkin&#8217; in everything boys and girls
do as quick as some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Mrs. Bonner, &#8220;if Colonel
Woodruff would be as friendly to Jim Irwin
if he knew that everybody says Jennie decided
he was to keep his certif&#8217;kit because she wants
him to get along in the world, so he can marry
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as she is so very friendly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
him,&#8221; replied Mrs. Bronson; &#8220;and Jim and
Jennie are both of age, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but how about our schools bein&#8217; ruined
by a love affair?&#8221; interrogated Mrs. Bonner, as
they moved away. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t that your business
and mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of desiring further knowledge of
what they were discussing, Jim felt a dreadful
disgust at the whole thing. Disgust at being
the subject of gossip, at the horrible falsity
of the picture he had been able to paint to the
people of his objects and his ambitions, and
especially at the desecration of Jennie by such
misconstruction of her attitude toward him
officially and personally. Jennie was vexed at
him, and wanted him to resign from his position.
He firmly believed that she was surprised
at finding herself convinced that he was entitled
to a decision in the matter of his competency
as a teacher. She was against him, he
believed, and as for her being in love with
him&mdash;to hear these women discuss it was intolerable.</p>
<p>He felt his face redden as at the hearing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
some horrible indecency. He felt himself
stripped naked, and he was hotly ashamed that
Jennie should be associated with him in the
exposure. And while he was raging inwardly,
paying the penalty of his new-found place in
the public eye&mdash;a publicity to which he was
not yet hardened&mdash;he heard other voices. Professor
Withers, County Superintendent Jennie
and Colonel Woodruff were making an inspection
of the rural-school exhibit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear he has been having some trouble
with his school board,&#8221; the professor was
saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;he has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there an effort made to remove him
from his position?&#8221; asked the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Proceedings before me to revoke his certificate,&#8221;
replied Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;On what grounds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Incompetency,&#8221; answered Jennie. &#8220;I found
that his pupils were really doing very well in
the regular course of study&mdash;which he seems
to be neglecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you supported him,&#8221; said the
professor. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to find you helping him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
&#8220;Really,&#8221; protested Jennie, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
myself&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of his notions?&#8221; asked
the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very advanced,&#8221; replied Professor Withers.
&#8220;Where did he imbibe them all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a Brown Mouse,&#8221; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said the puzzled
professor. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite understand. A&mdash;a&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of papa&#8217;s breeding jokes,&#8221; said Jennie.
&#8220;He means a phenomenon in heredity&mdash;perhaps
a genius, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see,&#8221; replied the professor, &#8220;a Mendelian
segregation, you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;The sort of
mind that imbibes things from itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s rather wonderful,&#8221; declared the
professor. &#8220;I had him to lunch to-day. He
surprised me. I have invited him to make an
address at Ames next winter during farmers&#8217;
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie&#8217;s tone showed her astonishment. Jim
the underling. Jim the off ox. Jim the thorn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
in the county superintendent&#8217;s side. Jim the
country teacher! It was stupefying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you musn&#8217;t judge him by his looks,&#8221;
said the professor. &#8220;I really do hope he&#8217;ll take
some advice on the matter of clothes&mdash;put on
a cravat and a different shirt and collar when
he comes to Ames&mdash;but I have no doubt he
will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t any other,&#8221; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t signify, if he has the truth
to tell us,&#8221; said the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Has</i> he?&#8221; asked Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Woodruff,&#8221; replied the professor
earnestly, &#8220;he has something that looks toward
truth, and something that we need. Just how
far he will go, just what he will amount to,
it is impossible to say. But something must
be done for the rural schools&mdash;something along
the lines he is trying to follow. He is a struggling
soul, and he is worth helping. You won&#8217;t
make any mistake if you make the most of Mr.
Irwin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim slipped out of a side door and fled. As
in the case of the conversation between Mrs.
Bronson and Mrs. Bonner, he was unable to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
discern the favorable auspices in the showing
of adverse things. He had not sensed Mrs.
Bronson&#8217;s half-concealed friendliness for him,
though it was disagreeably plain to Mrs.
Bonner. And now he neglected the colonel&#8217;s
evident support of him, and Professor Withers&#8217;
praise, in Jennie&#8217;s manifest surprise that old
Jim had been accorded the recognition of a
place on a college program, and the professor&#8217;s
criticism of his dress and general appearance.</p>
<p>It was unjust! What chance had he been
given to discover what it was fashionable to
wear, even if he had had the money to buy
such clothes as other young men possessed? He
would never go near Ames! He would stay
in the Woodruff District where the people
knew him, and some of them liked him. He
would finish his school year, and go back to
work on the farm. He would abandon the
struggle.</p>
<p>He started home, on foot as he had come,
A mile or so out he was overtaken by the
colonel, driving briskly along with room in his
buggy for Jim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Climb in, Jim!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Dan and Dolly
didn&#8217;t like to see you walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re looking fine,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>There is a good deal to say whenever two
horse lovers get together. Hoofs and coats
and frogs and eyes and teeth and the queer
sympathies between horse and man may sometimes
quite take the place of the weather for
an hour or so. But when Jim had alighted at
his own door, the colonel spoke of what had
been in his mind all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Bonner and Haakon and Ez doing
some caucusing to-day,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They expect
to elect Bonner to the board again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose so,&#8221; replied Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what shall we do about it?&#8221; asked the
colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the people want him&mdash;&#8221; began Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;must have
a choice offered to &#8217;em, or how can you or any
man tell what they want? How can they tell
themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim was silent. Here was a matter on
which he really had no ideas except the broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and general one that truth is mighty and shall
prevail&mdash;but that the speed of its forward
march is problematical.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;that it&#8217;s up to
us to see that the people have a chance to
decide. It&#8217;s really Bonner against Jim Irwin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather startling,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but I
suppose it&#8217;s true. And much chance Jim Irwin
has!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I calculate,&#8221; rejoined the colonel, &#8220;that
what you need is a champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To do what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To take that office away from Bonner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m free to say I don&#8217;t know that
any one can, but I&#8217;m willing to try. I think
that in about a week I shall pass the word
around that I&#8217;d like to serve my country on
the school board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face lighted up&mdash;and then darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even then they&#8217;d be two to one, Colonel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; replied the colonel, &#8220;and maybe
not. That would have to be figured on. A
cracked log splits easy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; Jim went on, &#8220;what&#8217;s the use? I
shan&#8217;t be disturbed this year&mdash;and after that&mdash;what&#8217;s
the use?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jim,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;you aren&#8217;t
getting short of breath are you? Do I see
frost on your boots? I thought you good for
the mile, and you aren&#8217;t turning out a quarter
horse, are you? I don&#8217;t know what all it is
you want to do, but I don&#8217;t, believe you can
do it in nine months, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in nine years!&#8221; replied Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, let&#8217;s plan for ten years,&#8221; said
the colonel. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to become a reformer
at my time of life as a temporary job.
Will you stick if we can swing the thing for
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Jim, in the manner of a person
taking the vows in some solemn initiation.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep
quiet and see how many votes we can muster
up at the election. How many can you speak
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim gave himself for a few minutes to
thought. It was a new thing to him, this matter
of mustering votes&mdash;and a thing which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
had always looked upon as rather reprehensible.
The citizen should go forth with no
coercion, no persuasion, no suggestion, and
vote his sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many can you round up?&#8221; persisted
the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that I can speak for
myself and Old Man Simms!&#8221;</p>
<p>The colonel laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine politician!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Fine politician!
Well, Jim, we may get beaten in this,
but if we are, let&#8217;s not have them going away
picking their noses and saying they&#8217;ve had no
fight. You round up yourself and Old Man
Simms and I&#8217;ll see what I can do&mdash;I&#8217;ll see what
I can do!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A MINOR CASTS HALF A VOTE</h3>
</div>

<p>March came in like neither a lion nor a
lamb, but was scarcely a week old before
the wild ducks had begun to score the sky
above Bronson&#8217;s Slew looking for open water
and badly-harvested corn-fields. Wild geese,
too, honked from on high as if in wonder that
these great prairies on which their forefathers
had been wont fearlessly to alight had been
changed into a disgusting expanse of farms. If
geese are favored with the long lives in which
fable bids us believe, some of these venerable
honkers must have seen every vernal and autumnal
phase of the transformation from
boundless prairie to boundless corn-land. I
sometimes seem to hear in the bewildering
trumpetings of wild geese a cry of surprise
and protest at the ruin of their former paradise.
Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s hired man, Pete,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
had no such foolish notions, however. He
stopped Newton Bronson and Raymond Simms
as they tramped across the colonel&#8217;s pasture,
gun in hand, trying to make themselves believe
that the shooting was good.</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t no country to hunt in,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Did either of you fellows ever have any real
duck-shooting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mountings,&#8221; said Raymond, &#8220;air poor
places for ducks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not big enough water,&#8221; suggested Pete.
&#8220;Some wood-ducks, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Along the creeks and rivers, yes seh,&#8221; said
Raymond, &#8220;and sometimes a flock of wild geese
would get lost, and some bewildered, and a
man would shoot one or two&mdash;from the tops of
the ridges&mdash;but nothing to depend on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been nowhere,&#8221; said Newton,
&#8220;except once to Minnesota&mdash;and&mdash;and that
wasn&#8217;t in the shooting season.&#8221;</p>
<p>A year ago Newton would have boasted of
having &#8220;bummed&#8221; his way to Faribault. His
hesitant speech was a proof of the embarrassment
his new respectability sometimes inflicted
upon him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I used to shoot ducks for the market at
Spirit Lake,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;I know Fred Gilbert
just as well as I know you. If I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; kep&#8217; on
shooting I could have made my millions as
champion wing shot as easy as he has. He
didn&#8217;t have nothing on me when we was both
shooting for a livin&#8217;. But that&#8217;s all over, now.
You&#8217;ve got to go so fur now to get decent
shooting where the farmers won&#8217;t drive you
off, that it costs nine dollars to send a postcard
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll have fine shooting on the slew
in a few days,&#8221; said Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; scoffed Pete. &#8220;I give you my
word, if I hadn&#8217;t promised the colonel I&#8217;d stay
with him another year, I&#8217;d take a side-door
Pullman for the Sand Hills of Nebraska or
the Devil&#8217;s Lake country to-morrow&mdash;if I had
a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for a passel of things that keep
me hyeh,&#8221; said Raymond, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The colonel,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;needs me. He
needs me in the election to-morrow. What&#8217;s
the matter of your ol&#8217; man, Newt? What for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
does he vote for that Bonner, and throw down
an old neighbor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything with him!&#8221; exclaimed
Newton irritably. &#8220;He&#8217;s all tangled up with
Peterson and Bonner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;if he&#8217;d just stay at home,
it would help some. If he votes for Bonner,
it&#8217;ll be just about a stand-off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never misses a vote!&#8221; said Newton
despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you cripple him someway?&#8221; asked
Pete jocularly. &#8220;Darned funny when a boy o&#8217;
your age can&#8217;t control his father&#8217;s vote! So
long!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I <i>could</i> vote!&#8221; grumbled Newton. &#8220;I
wish I <i>could</i>! We know a lot more about the
school, and Jim Irwin bein&#8217; a good teacher than
dad does&mdash;and we can&#8217;t vote. Why can&#8217;t folks
vote when they are interested in an election,
and know about the issues. It&#8217;s tyranny that
you and I can&#8217;t vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; said Raymond, the conservative,
&#8220;that the old-time people that fixed it thataway
knowed best.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rats!&#8221; sneered Newton, the iconoclast.
&#8220;Why, Calista knows more about the election of
school director than dad knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t seem reasonable,&#8221; protested
Raymond. &#8220;She&#8217;s prejudyced, I reckon, in
favor of Mr. Jim Irwin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dad&#8217;s prejudiced against him,&mdash;er,
no, he hain&#8217;t either. He likes Jim. He&#8217;s just
prejudiced against giving up his old notions.
No, he hain&#8217;t neither&mdash;I guess he&#8217;s only prejudiced
against seeming to give up some old notions
he seemed to have once! And the kids
in school would be prejudiced right, anyhow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paw says he&#8217;ll be on hand prompt,&#8221; said
Raymond. &#8220;But he had to be p&#8217;swaded right
much. Paw&#8217;s proud&mdash;and he cain&#8217;t read.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think the more people read the
less sense they&#8217;ve got,&#8221; said Newton. &#8220;I wish
I could tie dad up! I wish I could get snakebit,
and make him go for the doctor!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys crossed the ridge to the wooded
valley in which nestled the Simms cabin. They
found Mrs. Simms greatly exercised in her
mind because young McGeehee had been found
playing with some blue vitriol used by Raymond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
in his school work on the treatment of
seed potatoes for scab.</p>
<p>&#8220;His hands was all blue with it,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Do you reckon, Mr. Newton, that it&#8217;ll pizen
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he swallow any of it?&#8221; asked Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah!&#8221; said McGeehee scornfully.</p>
<p>Newton reassured Mrs. Simms, and went
away pensive. He was in rebellion against the
strange ways grown men have of discharging
their duties as citizens&mdash;a rather remarkable
thing, and perhaps a proof that Jim Irwin&#8217;s
methods had already accomplished much in
preparing Newton and Raymond for citizenship.
He had shown them the fact that voting
really has some relation to life. At present,
however, the new wine in the old bottles was
causing Newton to forget his filial duty, and
his respect for his father. He wished he could
lock him up in the barn so he couldn&#8217;t go to
the school election. He wished he could become
ill&mdash;or poisoned with blue vitriol or something&mdash;so
his father would be obliged to go for a
doctor. He wished&mdash;&mdash;well, why couldn&#8217;t he
get sick. Mrs. Simms had been about to send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
for the doctor for Buddy when he had explained
away the apparent necessity. People
got dreadfully scared about poison&mdash;&mdash; Newton
mended his pace, and looked happier. He
looked very much as he had done on the day
he adjusted the needle-pointed muzzle to his
dog&#8217;s nose. He looked, in fact, more like a
person filled with deviltry, than one yearning
for the right to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix him!&#8221; said he to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What time&#8217;s the election, Ez?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Bronson at breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; at four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Ezra. &#8220;And
I don&#8217;t want to hear any more from any one&#8221;&mdash;looking
at Newton&mdash;&#8220;about the election. It&#8217;s
none of the business of the women an&#8217; boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton took this reproof in an unexpectedly
submissive spirit. In fact, he exhibited his
very best side to the family that morning, like
one going on a long journey, or about to be
married off, or engaged in some deep dark
plot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re off trampin&#8217; the slews at
the sight of a flock of ducks four miles off as
usual?&#8221; stated Mr. Bronson challengingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Newton, &#8220;that I&#8217;d get a
lot of raisin bait ready for the pocket-gophers
in the lower meadow. They&#8217;ll be throwing up
their mounds by the first of April.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not them,&#8221; said Mr. Bronson, somewhat
mollified, &#8220;not before May. Where&#8217;d you get
the raisin idee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We learned it in school,&#8221; answered Newton.
&#8220;Jim had me study a bulletin on the control
and eradication of pocket-gophers. You use
raisins with strychnine in &#8217;em&mdash;and it tells
how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some fool notion, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; said Mr.
Bronson, rising. &#8220;But go ahead if you&#8217;re careful
about handlin&#8217; the strychnine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton spent the time from twelve-thirty
to half after two in watching the clock; and
twenty minutes to three found him seated in
the woodshed with a pen-knife in his hand, a
small vial of strychnine crystals on a stand
before him, a saucer of raisins at his right
hand, and one exactly like it, partially filled
with gopher bait&mdash;by which is meant raisins
under the skin of each of which a minute
crystal of strychnine had been inserted on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
point of the knife. Newton was apparently
happy and was whistling <i>The Glow-Worm</i>. It
was a lovely scene if one can forget the gopher&#8217;s
point of view.</p>
<p>At three-thirty, Newton went into the house
and lay down on the horsehair sofa, saying to
his mother that he felt kind o&#8217; funny and
thought he&#8217;d lie down a while. At three-forty
he heard his father&#8217;s voice in the kitchen and
knew that his sire was preparing to start for
the scene of battle between Colonel Woodruff
and Con Bonner, on the result of which hinged
the future of Jim Irwin and the Woodruff
school.</p>
<p>A groan issued from Newton&#8217;s lips&mdash;a
gruesome groan as of the painful death of a
person very sensitive to physical suffering.
But his father&#8217;s voice from the kitchen door
betrayed no agitation. He was scolding the
horses as they stood tied to the hitching-post,
in tones that showed no knowledge of his
son&#8217;s distressed moans.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Newton&#8217;s little sister who asked the
question, her facial expression evincing appreciation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
of Newton&#8217;s efforts in the line of
groans, somewhat touched with awe. Even
though regarded as a pure matter of make-believe,
such sounds were terrible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sister, sister!&#8221; howled Newton, &#8220;run
and tell &#8217;em that brother&#8217;s dying!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fanny disappeared in a manner which
expressed her balanced feelings&mdash;she felt that
her brother was making believe, but she believed
for all that, that something awful was
the matter. So she went rather slowly to the
kitchen door, and casually remarked that
Newton was dying on the sofa in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little fraud!&#8221; said her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Fanny!&#8221; said her mother&mdash;and ran
into the sitting-room&mdash;whence in a moment,
with a cry that was almost a scream, she summoned
her husband, who responded at the top
of his speed.</p>
<p>Newton was groaning and in convulsions.
Horrible grimaces contorted his face, his jaws
were set, his arms and legs drawn up, and
his muscles tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; His father&#8217;s voice was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
stern as well as full of anxiety. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
matter, boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Newton. &#8220;Oh! Oh! Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Newtie, Newtie!&#8221; cried his mother, &#8220;where
are you in pain? Tell mother, Newtie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; groaned Newtie, relaxing, &#8220;I feel
awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you been eating?&#8221; interrogated his
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you eatin&#8217; dinner,&#8221; said his father.</p>
<p>Again Newton was convulsed by strong
spasms, and again his groans filled the hearts
of his parents with terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve eaten,&#8221; said he, when his
spasms had passed, &#8220;except a few raisins. I
was putting strychnine in &#8217;em&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, heavens!&#8221; cried his mother. &#8220;He&#8217;s
poisoned! Drive for the doctor, Ezra! Drive!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bronson forgot all about the election&mdash;forgot
everything save antidotes and speed. He
leaped toward the door. As he passed out, he
shouted &#8220;Give him an emetic!&#8221; He tore the
hitching straps from the posts, jumped into the
buggy and headed for the road. Skilfully avoiding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
an overturn as he rounded into the highway,
he gave the spirited horses their heads,
and fled toward town, carefully computing the
speed the horses could make and still be able
to return. Mile after mile he covered, passing
teams, keeping ahead of automobiles and advertising
panic. Just at the town limits, he
met the doctor in Sheriff Dilly&#8217;s automobile,
the sheriff himself at the steering wheel. Mr.
Bronson signaled them to stop, ignoring the
fact that they were making similar signs to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just starting for your place,&#8221; said
the doctor. &#8220;Your wife got me on the phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; replied Bronson. &#8220;Don&#8217;t fool
any time away on me. Drive!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in here, Ez,&#8221; said the sheriff. &#8220;Doc
knows how to drive, and I&#8217;ll come on with your
team. They need a slow drive to cool &#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you phone me?&#8221; asked the
doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never thought of it,&#8221; replied Bronson. &#8220;I
hain&#8217;t had the phone only a few years. Drive
faster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get there, or I would,&#8221; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
the doctor. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. From what your
wife told me over the phone I don&#8217;t believe
the boy&#8217;s eaten any more strychnine than I
have&mdash;and probably not so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was alive, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive and making an argument against
taking the emetic,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;But
I guess she got it down him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to lose that boy, Doc!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any danger. It
doesn&#8217;t sound like a genuine poisoning case
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus reassured, Mr. Bronson was calm, even
if somewhat tragic in calmness, when he
entered the death chamber with the doctor.
Newton was sitting up, his eyes wet, and his
face pale. His mother had won the argument,
and Newton had lost his dinner. Haakon
Peterson occupied an armchair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; asked the doctor. &#8220;How
you feeling, Newt? Any pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; said Newton. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give
me any more o&#8217; that nasty stuff!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;but if you don&#8217;t tell
me just what you&#8217;ve been eating, and doing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
and pulling off on us, I&#8217;ll use this&#8221;&mdash;and the
doctor exhibited a huge stomach pump.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do with that?&#8221; asked Newton
faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put this down into your hold, and unload
you, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the election over, Mr. Peterson?&#8221; asked
Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mr. Peterson, &#8220;and the
votes counted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s elected?&#8221; asked Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel Woodruff,&#8221; answered Mr. Peterson.
&#8220;The vote was twelve to eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dad,&#8221; said Newton, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll
be sore, but the only way I could see to get in
half a vote for Colonel Woodruff was to get
poisoned and send you after the doctor. If
you&#8217;d gone, it would &#8217;a&#8217; been a tie, anyhow, and
probably you&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; persuaded somebody to
change to Bonner. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter
with me. I killed your vote. Now, you can
do whatever you like to me&mdash;but I&#8217;m sorry I
scared mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ezra Bronson seized Newton by the
throat, but his fingers failed to close. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
pinch, dad,&#8221; said Newton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been using
that neck an&#8217; it&#8217;s tired.&#8221; Mr. Bronson dropped
his hands to his sides, glared at his son for a
moment and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you darned infernal little fool,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion to take a hamestrap to
you! If I&#8217;d been there the vote would have
been eleven to thirteen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was plenty wotes there for the colonel,
if he needed &#8217;em,&#8221; said Haakon, whose politician&#8217;s
mind was already fully adjusted to the
changed conditions. &#8220;Ay tank the Woodruff
District will have a junanimous school board
from dis time on once more. Colonel Woodruff
is yust the man we have needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you there,&#8221; said Bronson. &#8220;And
as for you, young man, if one or both of them
horses is hurt by the run I give them, I&#8217;ll lick
you within an inch of your life&mdash;&mdash; Here
comes Dilly driving &#8217;em in now&mdash;&mdash; I guess
they&#8217;re all right. I wouldn&#8217;t want to drive a
good team to death for any young hoodlum like
him&mdash;&mdash; All right, how much do I owe you.
Doc?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE GLORIOUS FOURTH</h3>
</div>

<p>A good deal of water ran under the
Woodruff District bridges in the weeks
between the school election and the Fourth
of July picnic at Eight-Mile Grove. They were
very important weeks to Jim Irwin, though
outwardly uneventful. Great events are often
mere imperceptible developments of the
spirit.</p>
<p>Spring, for instance, brought a sort of
spiritual crisis to Jim; for he had to face the
accusing glance of the fields as they were
plowed and sown while he lived indoors. As
he labored at the tasks of the Woodruff school
he was conscious of a feeling not very easily
distinguished from a sense of guilt. It seemed
that there must be something almost wicked
in his failure to be afield with his team in the
early spring mornings when the woolly anemones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
appeared in their fur coats, the heralds
of the later comers&mdash;violets, sweet-williams,
puccoons, and the scarlet prairie lilies.</p>
<p>A moral crisis accompanies the passing of
a man from the struggle with the soil to any
occupation, the productiveness of which is not
quite so clear. It requires a keenly sensitive
nature to feel conscious of it, but Jim Irwin
possessed such a temperament; and from the
beginning of the daily race with the seasons,
which makes the life of a northern farmer an
eight months&#8217; Marathon in which to fall behind
for a week is to lose much of the year&#8217;s
reward, the gawky schoolmaster slept uneasily,
and heard the earliest cock-crow as a soldier
hears a call to arms to which he has made up
his mind he will not respond.</p>
<p>I think there is a real moral principle
involved. I believe that this deep instinct for
labor in and about the soil is a valid one, and
that the gathering together of people in cities
has been at the cost of an obscure but actual
moral shock.</p>
<p>I doubt if the people of the cities can ever
be at rest in a future full of moral searchings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
of conscience until every man has traced
definitely the connection of the work he is
doing with the maintenance of his country&#8217;s
population. Sometimes those vocations whose
connection can not be so traced will be recognized
as wicked ones, and people engaged in
them will feel as did Jim&mdash;until he worked out
the facts in the relation of school-teaching to
the feeding, clothing and sheltering of the
world. Most school-teaching he believed&mdash;correctly
or incorrectly&mdash;has very little to do with
the primary task of the human race; but as far
as his teaching was concerned, even he believed
in it. If by teaching school he could
not make a greater contribution to the productiveness
of the Woodruff District than by
working in the fields, he would go back to the
fields. Whether he could make his teaching
thus productive or not was the very fact in
issue between him and the local body politic.</p>
<p>These are some of the waters that ran under
the bridges before the Fourth of July picnic at
Eight-Mile Grove. Few surface indications
there were of any change in the little community
in this annual gathering of friends and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
neighbors. Wilbur Smythe made the annual
address, and was in rather finer fettle than
usual as he paid his fervid tribute to the starry
flag, and to this very place as the most favored
spot in the best country of the greatest state
in the most powerful, intellectual, freest and
most progressive nation in the best possible
of worlds. Wilbur was going strong. Jim Irwin
read the Declaration rather well, Jennie Woodruff
thought, as she sat on the platform between
Deacon Avery, the oldest settler in the
district, and Mrs. Columbus Brown, the sole
local representative of the Daughters of the
American Revolution. Colonel Woodruff presided
in his Grand Army of the Republic
uniform.</p>
<p>The fresh northwest breeze made free with
the oaks, elms, hickories and box-elders of
Eight-Mile Grove, and the waters of Pickerel
Creek glimmered a hundred yards away, beyond
the flitting figures of the boys who preferred
to shoot off their own fire-crackers and torpedoes
and nigger-chasers, rather than to
listen to those of Wilbur Smythe. Still farther
off could be heard the voice of a lone lemonade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
vender as he advertised ice-cold lemonade,
made in the shade, with a brand-new spade,
by an old maid, as a guaranty that it was the
blamedest, coldest lemonade ever sold. And
under the shadiest trees a few incorrigible
Marthas were spreading the snowy tablecloths
on which would soon be placed the bountiful
repasts stored in ponderous wicker baskets
and hampers. It was a lovely day, in a
lovely spot&mdash;a good example of the miniature
forests which grew naturally from time immemorial
in favored locations on the Iowa
prairies&mdash;half a square mile of woodland, all
about which the green corn-rows stood aslant
in the cool breeze, &#8220;waist-high and laid by.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were passing down the rough board
steps from the platform after the exercises had
terminated in a rousing rendition of <i>America</i>,
when Jennie Woodruff, having slipped by
everybody else to reach him, tapped Jim Irwin
on the arm. He looked back at her over his
shoulder with his slow gentle smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t your mother here, Jim?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking all over the crowd and can&#8217;t
see her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; answered Jim. &#8220;I was in
hopes that when she broke loose and went to
your Christmas dinner she would stay loose&mdash;but
she went home and settled back into her
rut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;She&#8217;d have had a
nice time if she had come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I believe she would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want help,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;Our hamper
is terribly heavy. Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was rather obvious to Mrs. Bonner that
Jennie was throwing herself at Jim&#8217;s head; but
that was an article of the Bonner family creed
since the decision which closed the hearing at
the court-house. It must be admitted that the
young county superintendent found tasks which
kept the schoolmaster very close to her side. He
carried the hamper, helped Jennie to spread the
cloth on the grass, went with her to the well
for water and cracked ice wherewith to cool it.
In fact, he quite cut Wilbur Smythe out when
that gentleman made ponderous efforts to obtain
a share of the favor implied in these permissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Jim,&#8221; said Mrs. Woodruff, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
earned a bite of what we&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s good
enough, what there is of it, and there&#8217;s enough
of it, such as it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve a prior engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jim!&#8221; protested Jennie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
counting on you. Don&#8217;t desert me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but I promised.
I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might have thought, judging by the
colonel&#8217;s quizzical smile, that he was pleased at
Jennie&#8217;s loss of her former swain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to invite Jim longer ahead of
time,&#8221; said he. &#8220;He&#8217;s getting to be in demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed to be in demand&mdash;a fact that Jennie
confirmed by observation as she chatted
with Deacon Avery, Mrs. Columbus Brown and
her husband, and the Orator of the Day, at the
table set apart for the guests and notables. Jim
received a dozen invitations as he passed the
groups seated on the grass&mdash;one of them from
Mrs. Cornelius Bonner, who saw no particular
point in advertising disgruntlement. The children
ran to him and clung to his hands; young
girls gave him sisterly smiles and such trifles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
as chicken drumsticks, pieces of cake and like
tidbits. His passage to the numerous groups
at a square table under a big burr-oak was
quite an ovation&mdash;an ovation of the significance
of which he was himself quite unaware.
The people were just friendly, that was all&mdash;to
his mind.</p>
<p>But Jennie&mdash;the daughter of a politician and
a promising one herself&mdash;Jennie sensed the
fact that Jim Irwin had won something from
the people of the Woodruff District in the way
of deference. Still he was the gangling, Lincolnian,
ill-dressed, poverty-stricken Jim Irwin
of old, but Jennie had no longer the feeling
that one&#8217;s standing was somewhat compromised
by association with him. He had begun
to put on something more significant than
clothes, something which he had possessed all
the time, but which became valid only as it was
publicly apprehended. There was a slight air
of command in his down-sitting and up-rising
at the picnic. He was clearly the central figure
of his group, in which she recognized the
Bronsons, those queer children from Tennessee,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
the Simmses, the Talcotts, the Hansens,
the Hamms and Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s hired man,
Pete, whose other name is not recorded.</p>
<p>Jim sat down between Bettina Hansen, a
flaxen-haired young Brunhilde of seventeen,
and Calista Simms&mdash;Jennie saw him do it,
while listening to Wilbur Smythe&#8217;s account of
the exacting nature of the big law practise he
was building up,&mdash;and would have been glad to
exchange places with Calista or Bettina.</p>
<p>The repast drew to a close; and over by the
burr-oak the crowd had grown to a circle surrounding
Jim Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to be making an address,&#8221; said
Wilbur Smythe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Wilbur,&#8221; replied the colonel, &#8220;you had
the first shot at us. Suppose we move over
and see what&#8217;s under discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they approached the group, they heard
Jim Irwin answering something which Ezra
Bronson had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so, Ezra,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and it seems
reasonable that big creameries like those at
Omaha, Sioux City, Des Moines and the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
centralizer points can make butter cheaper
than we would do here&mdash;but we&#8217;ve the figures
that show that they aren&#8217;t economical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t make good butter, for one
thing,&#8221; said Newton Bronson cockily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t they?&#8221; asked Olaf Hansen, the
father of Bettina.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Newton, &#8220;they have to have so
much cream that they&#8217;ve got to ship it so far
that it gets rotten on the way, and they have
to renovate it with lime and other ingredients
before they can churn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Raymond Simms, &#8220;I reckon they
sell their butter fo&#8217; all it&#8217;s wuth; an&#8217; they cain&#8217;t
get within from foah to seven cents a pound
as much fo&#8217; it as the farmers&#8217; creameries in
Wisconsin and Minnesota get fo&#8217; theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact, Olaf,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you kids know so darned much
about it?&#8221; queried Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; sniffed Bettina. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been reading
about it, and writing letters about it, and
figuring percentages on it in school all winter.
We&#8217;ve done arithmetic and geography and
grammar and I don&#8217;t know what else on it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m agin&#8217; any schoolin&#8217;,&#8221; said Pete,
&#8220;that makes kids smarter in farmin&#8217; than their
parents and their parents&#8217; hired men. Gi&#8217; me
another swig o&#8217; that lemonade, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Jim to his audience, meanwhile
pouring the lemonade, &#8220;the centralizer
creamery is uneconomic in several ways. It
has to pay excessive transportation charges.
It has to pay excessive commissions to its cream
buyers. It has to accept cream without proper
inspection, and mixes the good with the bad.
It makes such long shipments that the cream
spoils in transit and lowers the quality of the
butter. It can&#8217;t make the best use of the buttermilk.
All these losses and leaks the farmers
have to stand. I can prove&mdash;and so can
the six or eight pupils in the Woodruff school
who have been working on the cream question
this winter&mdash;that we could make at least six
cents a pound on our butter if we had a cooperative
creamery and all sent our cream
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ezra Bronson, &#8220;let&#8217;s start
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go in,&#8221; said Olaf Hansen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Con Bonner.</p>
<p>There was a general chorus of assent. Jim
had convinced his audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the jury,&#8221; said Wilbur Smythe to
Colonel Woodruff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;and right here is
where he runs into danger. Can he handle the
crowd when it&#8217;s with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I think we ought to organize
one, but I&#8217;ve another proposition first.
Let&#8217;s get together and pool our cream. By
that, I mean that we&#8217;ll all sell to the same
creamery, and get the best we can out of the
centralizers by the cooperative method. We
can save two cents a pound in that way, and
we&#8217;ll learn to cooperate. When we have found
just how well we can hang together, we&#8217;ll be
able to take up the cooperative creamery, with
less danger of falling apart and failing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll handle the pool?&#8221; inquired Mr.
Hansen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll handle it in the school,&#8221; answered
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;School&#8217;s about done,&#8221; objected Mr. Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the cream pool pretty near pay the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
expenses of running the school all summer?&#8221;
asked Bonner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to run the school plant all the
time,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only way to get full
value out of the investment. And we&#8217;ve corn-club
work, pig-club work, poultry work and
canning-club work which make it very desirable
to keep in session with only a week&#8217;s vacation.
If you&#8217;ll add the cream pool, it will make
the school the hardest working crowd in the district
and doing actual farm work, too. I like
Mr. Bonner&#8217;s suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Haakon Peterson, who had
joined the group, &#8220;Ay tank we better have a
meeting of the board and discuss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, darn it,&#8221; said Columbus Brown, &#8220;I
want in on this cream pool&mdash;and I live outside
the district!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let you in, Clumb,&#8221; said the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;We hain&#8217;t no more
sense than to let any one in, Clumb. Come in,
the water&#8217;s fine. We ain&#8217;t proud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Clumb, &#8220;if this feller is goin&#8217;
to do school work of this kind, I want in the
district, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come to that one of these days,&#8221; said
Jim. &#8220;The district is too small.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilbur Smythe&#8217;s car stopped at the distant
gate and honked for him&mdash;a signal which broke
up the party. Haakon Peterson passed the
word to the colonel and Mr. Bronson for a
board meeting the next evening. The picnic
broke up in a dispersion of staid married couples
to their homes, and young folks in top
buggies to dances and displays of fireworks in
the surrounding villages. Jim walked across
the fields to his home&mdash;neither old nor young,
having neither sweetheart with whom to dance
nor farm to demand labor in its inexorable
chores. He turned after crawling through a
wire fence and looked longingly at Jennie as
she was suavely assisted into the car by the
frock-coated lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw what he did?&#8221; said the colonel interrogatively,
as he and his daughter sat on
the Woodruff veranda that evening. &#8220;Who
taught him the supreme wisdom of holding
back his troops when they grew too wild for
attack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may lose them,&#8221; said Jennie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;Individuals of
the Brown Mouse type always succeed when
they find their environment. And I believe
Jim has found his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;I wish his environment
would find him some clothes. It&#8217;s a
shame the way he has to go looking. He&#8217;d be
nice-appearing if he was dressed anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he?&#8221; queried the colonel. &#8220;I wonder,
now! Well, Jennie, as his oldest friend having
any knowledge of clothes, I think it&#8217;s up
to you to act as a committee of one on Jim&#8217;s
apparel.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A TROUBLE SHOOTER</h3>
</div>

<p>A sudden July storm had drenched the
fields and filled the swales with water.
The cultivators left the corn-fields until the
next day&#8217;s sun and a night of seepage might
once more fit the black soil for tillage. The
little boys rolled up their trousers and tramped
home from school with the rich mud squeezing
up between their toes, thrilling with the electricity
of clean-washed nature, and the little
girls rather wished they could go barefooted,
too, as, indeed, some of the more sensible did.</p>
<p>A lithe young man with climbers on his legs
walked up a telephone pole by the roadside to
make some repairs to the wires, which had been
whipped into a &#8220;cross&#8221; by the wind of the storm
and the lashing of the limbs of the roadside
trees. He had tied his horse to a post up the
road, and was running out the trouble on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
line, which was plentifully in evidence just
then. Wind and lightning had played hob with
the system, and the line repairer was cheerfully
profane, in the manner of his sort, glad
by reason of the fire of summer in his veins,
and incensed at the forces of nature which had
brought him out through the mud to the Woodruff
District to do these piffling jobs that any
of the subscribers ought to have known how
to do themselves, and none of which took more
than a few minutes of his time when he reached
the seat of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Jim Irwin, his school out for the day, came
along the muddy road with two of his pupils,
a bare-legged little boy and a tall girl with
flaxen hair&mdash;Bettina Hansen and her small
brother Hans, who refused to answer to any
name other than Hans Nilsen. His father&#8217;s
name was Nils Hansen, and Hans, a born conservative,
being the son of Nils, regarded himself
as rightfully a Nilsen, and disliked the
&#8220;Hans Hansen&#8221; on the school register. Thus
do European customs sometimes survive among
us.</p>
<p>Hans strode through the pool of water which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the shower had spread completely over the low
turnpike a few rods from the pole on which
the trouble shooter was at work, and the electrician
ceased his labors and rested himself on
a cross-arm while he waited to see what the
flaxen-haired girl would do when she came to it.</p>
<p>Jim and Bettina stopped at the water&#8217;s edge.
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried she, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get through!&#8221; The
trouble shooter felt the impulse to offer his
aid, but thought it best on the whole, to leave
the matter in the hands of the lank schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry you across,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too heavy,&#8221; answered Bettina.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s awful heavy,&#8221; piped Hans. &#8220;Better
take off your shoes, anyhow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim thought of the welfare of his only good
trousers, and saw that Hans&#8217; suggestion was
good; but a mental picture of himself with
shoes in hand and bare legs restrained him.
He took Bettina in his arms and went slowly
across, walking rather farther with his blushing
burden than was strictly necessary. Bettina
was undoubtedly heavy; but she was also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
wonderfully pleasant to feel in arms which had
never borne such a burden before; and her
arms about his neck as he slopped through the
pond were curiously thrilling. Her cheek
brushed his as he set her upon her feet and
felt, rather than thought, that if there had only
been a good reason for it, Bettina would have
willingly been carried much farther.</p>
<p>&#8220;How strong you are!&#8221; she panted. &#8220;I&#8217;m
awful heavy, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; said Jim, with scholastic accuracy.
&#8220;You&#8217;re just right. I&mdash;I mean,
you&#8217;re simply well-nourished and wholesomely
plump!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bettina blushed still more rosily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve ruined your clothes,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Now you&#8217;ll have to come home with me and
let me&mdash;see who&#8217;s there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim looked up at the trouble shooter, and
went over to the foot of the pole. The man
walked down, striking his spurs deep into the
wood for safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he. &#8220;School out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the day,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Any important
work on the telephone line now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just trouble-shooting,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I
have to spend three hours hunting these troubles,
to one in fixing &#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they take much technical skill?&#8221; asked
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly shakin&#8217; out crosses, and puttin&#8217; in
new carbons in the arresters,&#8221; replied the
trouble man. &#8220;Any one ought to do any of &#8217;em
with five minutes&#8217; instruction. But these
farmers&mdash;they&#8217;d rather have me drive ten
miles to take a hair-pin from across the binding-posts
than to do it themselves. That&#8217;s the
way they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be out here to-morrow?&#8221; queried
the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you show my class in manual
training something about the telephone,&#8221;
said Jim. &#8220;The reason we can&#8217;t fix our own
troubles, if they are as simple as you say, is
because we don&#8217;t know how simple they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do, Professor,&#8221; said
the trouble man. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring a phone with me
and give &#8217;em a lecture. I don&#8217;t see how I can
employ the company&#8217;s time any better than in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
beating a little telephone sense into the heads
of the community. Set the time, and I&#8217;ll be
there with bells.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bettina and her teacher walked on up the
shady lane, feeling that they had a secret.
They were very nearly on a parity as to the
innocence of soul with which they held this
secret, except that Bettina was much more
single-minded toward it than Jim. To her he
had been gradually attaining the status of a
hero whose clasp of her in that iron-armed way
was mysteriously blissful&mdash;and beyond that
her mind had not gone. To Jim, Bettina represented
in a very sweet way the disturbing influences
which had recently risen to the threshold
of consciousness in his being, and which
were concretely but not very hopefully embodied
in Jennie Woodruff.</p>
<p>Thus interested in each other, they turned
the corner which took them out of sight of the
lineman, and stopped at the shady avenue leading
up to Nils Hansen&#8217;s farmstead. Little
Hans Nilsen had disappeared by the simple
method of cutting across lots. Bettina&#8217;s girlish
instinct called for something more than the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
casual good-by which would have sufficed yesterday.
She lingered, standing close by Jim
Irwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in and let me clean the
mud off you,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;and give you some
dry socks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost as far
to your house as it is home. Thank you, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a splash of mud on your face,&#8221; said
Bettina. &#8220;Let me&mdash;&#8221; And with her little
handkerchief she began wiping off the mud.
Jim stooped to permit the attention, but not
much, for Bettina was of the mold of women
of whom warriors are born&mdash;their faces approached,
and Jim recognized a crisis in the
fact that Bettina&#8217;s mouth was presented for a
kiss. Jim met the occasion like the gentleman
he was. He did not leave her stung by rejection;
neither did he obey the impulse to respond
to the invitation according to his man&#8217;s instinct;
he took the rosy face between his palms
and kissed her forehead&mdash;and left her in possession
of her self-respect. After that Bettina
Hansen felt, somehow, that the world could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
not possibly contain another man like Jim Irwin&mdash;a
conviction which she still cherishes
when that respectful caress has been swept
into the cloudy distance of a woman&#8217;s memories.</p>
<p>Pete, Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s hired man, was
watering the horses at the trough when the
trouble shooter reached the Woodruff telephone.
County Superintendent Jennie had run
for her father&#8217;s home in her little motor-car
in the face of the shower, and was now on the
bench where once she had said &#8220;Humph!&#8221; to
Jim Irwin&mdash;and thereby started in motion the
factors in this story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything wrong with your phone?&#8221; asked
the trouble man of Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah,&#8221; replied Pete. &#8220;It was on the blink
till you done something down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crossed up,&#8221; said the lineman. &#8220;These
trees along here are something fierce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d cut &#8217;em all if they was mine,&#8221; said Pete,
&#8220;but the colonel set &#8217;em out, along about sixty-six,
and I reckon they&#8217;ll have to go on
a-growin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s your school-teacher?&#8221; asked the telephone
man.</p>
<p>The county superintendent pricked up her
ears&mdash;being quite properly interested in matters
educational.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller name of Irwin,&#8221; said Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a looker,&#8221; said the trouble
shooter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nater of the sile,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;He an&#8217; I
both worked in it together till it roughened up
our complexions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farmer, eh?&#8221; said the lineman interrogatively.
&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s the first farmer I ever saw
in my life that recognized there&#8217;s education in
the telephone business. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to teach
a class in telephony at the schoolhouse to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get swelled up,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;He has
everybody tell them young ones about everything&mdash;blacksmith,
cabinet-maker, pie-founder,
cookie-cooper, dressmaker&mdash;even down to telephones.
He&#8217;ll have them scholars figurin&#8217; on
telephones, and writin&#8217; compositions on &#8217;em,
and learnin&#8217; &#8217;lectricity from &#8217;em an&#8217; things like
that&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He must be some feller,&#8221; said the lineman.
&#8220;And who&#8217;s his star pupil?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know he had one,&#8221; said Pete.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl,&#8221; said the trouble-shooter. &#8220;Goes to
school from the farm where the Western Union
brace is used at the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nils Hansen&#8217;s girl?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toppy little filly,&#8221; said the lineman, &#8220;with
silver mane&mdash;looks like she&#8217;d pull a good load
and step some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;h&#8217;m,&#8221; grunted Pete. &#8220;Bettina Hansen.
Looks well enough. What about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the county superintendent, seated on
the bench, pricked up her ears that she might
learn, mayhap, something of educational interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never wanted to be a school-teacher as
bad,&#8221; continued the shooter of trouble, &#8220;as I
did when this farmer got to the low place in
the road with the fair Bettina this afternoon
when they was comin&#8217; home from school. The
water was all over the road&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I win a smoke from the roadmaster,&#8221;
said Pete. &#8220;I bet him it would overflow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I was in the professor&#8217;s place, I&#8217;d
be glad to pay the bet,&#8221; said the worldly lineman.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll say this for him, he rose equal
to the emergency and caved the emergency&#8217;s
head in. He carried her across the pond, and
her a-clingin&#8217; to his neck in a way to make
your mouth water. She wasn&#8217;t a bit mad about
it, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have a good cigar any ol&#8217; time,&#8221;
said Pete. &#8220;Nothin&#8217; but a yaller-haired kid&mdash;an&#8217;
a Dane at that. I had a dame once up
at Spirit Lake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must be drivin&#8217; on,&#8221; said the lineman.
&#8220;Got to get up a lecture for Professor
Irwin to-morrow&mdash;and maybe I&#8217;ll be able to
meet that yaller-haired kid. So long!&#8221;</p>
<p>The county superintendent recognized at
once the educational importance of the matter,
when one of her country teachers adopted the
policy of calling in everybody available who
could teach the pupils anything special, and
converting the school into a local Chautauqua
served by local lecturers. She made a run of ten
miles to hear the trouble shooter&#8217;s lecture. She
saw the boys and some of the girls give an explanation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
of the telephone and the use of it.
She heard the teacher give as a language exercise
the next day an essay on the ethics and
proprieties of eavesdropping on party lines;
and she saw the beginning of an arrangement
under which the boys of the Woodruff school
took the contract to look after easily-remedied
line troubles in the neighborhood on the basis
which paid for a telephone for the school, and
swelled slightly the fund which Jim was accumulating
for general purposes. Incidentally,
she saw how really educational was the work
of the day, and that to which it led.</p>
<p>She had no curiosity to which she would
have confessed, about the relations between
Jim Irwin and his &#8220;star pupil,&#8221; that young
Brunhilde&mdash;Bettina Hansen; but her official
duty required her to observe the attitude of
pupils to teachers&mdash;Bettina among them.
Clearly, Jim was looked upon by the girls,
large and small, as a possession of theirs. They
competed for the task of keeping his desk in
order, and of dusting and tidying up the schoolroom.
There was something of exaltation of
sentiment in this. Bettina&#8217;s eyes followed him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
about the room in a devotional sort of way;
but so, too, did those of the ten-year-olds. He
was loved, that was clear, by Bettina, Calista
Simms and all the rest&mdash;an excellent thing in
a school.</p>
<p>All the same, Jennie met Jim rather oftener
after the curious conversation between those
rather low fellows, Pete and the trouble
shooter. As autumn approached, and the time
came for Jim to begin to think of his trip to
Ames, Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s hint that she should
assume charge of the problem of Jim&#8217;s clothes
for the occasion, came more and more often to
her mind. Would Jim be able to buy suitable
clothes? Would he understand that he ought
not to appear in the costume which was tolerable
in the Woodruff District only because the
people there were accustomed to seeing him
dressed like a tramp? Could she approach the
subject with any degree of safety? Really
these were delicate questions; and considering
the fact that Jennie had quite dismissed her
old sweetheart from the list of eligibles&mdash;had
never actually admitted him to it, in fact&mdash;they
assumed great importance to her mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Once, only a little more than a year ago, she
had scoffed at Jim&#8217;s mention of the fact that
he might think of marrying; and now she could
not think of saying to him kindly, &#8220;Jim, you
really must have some better clothes to wear
when you go to Ames!&#8221; It would have been
far easier last summer.</p>
<p>Somehow, Jim had been acquiring dignity
and unapproachability. She must sidle up to
the subject. She did. She took him into her
runabout one day as he was striding toward
town in that plowed-ground manner of his, and
gave him a spin over to the fair grounds and
two or three times around the half-mile track.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Ames to hear your speech,&#8221;
said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;More of the
farmers are going from this neighborhood than
ever before. I&#8217;ll feel at home, if they all sit
together where I can talk at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going?&#8221; asked Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bronsons, Con Bonner and Nils Hansen
and Bettina,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;That&#8217;s all
from our district&mdash;and Columbus Brown and
probably others from near-by localities.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to have some clothes,&#8221; said
Jennie.</p>
<p>Jim failed to respond to this, as clearly out
of his field. They were passing the county fair
buildings, and he began expatiating on the
kind of county fair he would have&mdash;a great
county exposition with the schools as its central
thought&mdash;a clearing house for the rural
activities of all the country schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;And pa&#8217;s going to have a suit before we
go, too,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;Here are some samples
I got of Atkins, the tailor. Which would
be the most becoming do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim looked the samples over carefully, but
had little to say as to their adaptation to
Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s sartorial needs. Jennie
laid great stress on the excellent quality of one
or two samples, and carefully specified the
prices of them. Jim exhibited no more than
a languid and polite interest, and gave not the
slightest symptom of ever having considered
even remotely the contingency of having a
tailor-made suit. Jennie sidled closer to the
subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it would be awfully hard for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
you to get fitted in the stores,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you
are so very tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;if I had ever considered
the matter of looks very much. I guess
I&#8217;m not constructed on any plan the clothing
manufacturers have regarded as even remotely
possible. How about this county fair idea?
Couldn&#8217;t we do this next fall? You organize
the teachers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie advanced the spark, cut out the muffler
and drowned the rest of Jim&#8217;s remarks in
wind and dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it up, dad,&#8221; said she to her father
that evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; queried the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Irwin&#8217;s clothes,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I think
he&#8217;ll go to Ames in a disgraceful plight, but I
can&#8217;t get any closer to the subject than I have
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you haven&#8217;t heard the news,&#8221; said
the colonel. &#8220;Jim&#8217;s going to have his first
made-to-measure suit for Ames. It&#8217;s all fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s making it?&#8221; asked Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gustaf Paulsen, the Dane that&#8217;s just opened
a shop in town.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
&#8220;A Dane?&#8221; queried Jennie. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he related
to some of the neighbors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A brother to Mrs. Hansen,&#8221; answered the
colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bettina&#8217;s uncle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ratherly,&#8221; said the colonel jocularly, &#8220;seeing
as how Bettina&#8217;s Mrs. Hansen&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clothes are rather important, but the difference
between a suit made by Atkins the
tailor, and one built by Gustaf Paulsen, the
new Danish craftsman, could not be supposed
to be crucially important, even when designed
for a very dear friend. And Jim was scarcely
that&mdash;of course not! Why, then, did the
county superintendent hastily run to her room,
and cry? Why did she say to herself that the
Hansens were very good people, and well-to-do,
and it would be a fine thing for Jim and his
mother,&mdash;and then cry some more? Colonel
failed to notice Jennie&#8217;s unceremonious retirement
from circulation that evening, and had he
known all about what took place, he would
have been as mystified as you or I.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>JIM GOES TO AMES</h3>
</div>

<p>The boat tipped over, and Jim Irwin was
left struggling in the water. It was in the
rapids just above the cataract&mdash;and poor Jim
could not swim a stroke. Helpless, terrified,
gasping, he floated to destruction, and Jennie
Woodruff was not able to lift a hand to help
him. To see any human being swept to such
an end is dreadful, but for a county superintendent
to witness the drowning of one of her
best&mdash;though sometimes it must be confessed
most insubordinate&mdash;teachers, under such circumstances,
is unspeakable; and when that
teacher is a young man who was once that
county superintendent&#8217;s sweetheart, and falls
in, clothed in a new made-to-order suit in
which he looks almost handsome despite his
manifest discomfort in his new cravat and
starched collar, the experience is something almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
impossible to endure. That is why Jennie
gripped her seat until she must have
scratched the varnish. That is why she felt
she must go to him&mdash;and do something. She
could not endure it a moment longer, she felt;
and there he floated away, his poor pale face
dipping below the waves, his sad, long, homely
countenance sadder than ever, his lovely&mdash;yes,
she must confess it now, his eyes were lovely!&mdash;his
lovely blue eyes, so honest and true, wide
with terror; and she unable to give him so
much as a cry of encouragement!</p>
<p>And then Jim began to swim. He cast aside
the roll of manuscript which he had held in
his hand when the waters began to rise about
him, and struck out for the shore with strong
strokes&mdash;wild and agitated at first, but gradually
becoming controlled and coordinated, and
Jennie drew a long breath as he finally came
to shore, breasting the waves like Triton, and
master of the element in which he moved.
There was a burst of applause, and people went
forward to congratulate the greenhorn who
had really made good.</p>
<p>Jennie felt like throwing her arms about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
his neck and weeping out her joy at his escape,
and his restoration to her. Her eyes told
him something of this; for there was a look
in them which reminded him of fifteen years
ago. Bettina Hansen was proud of him, and
Con Bonner shook his hand and said that he
agreed with him. Neither Bettina nor Con had
noticed the capsizing of the boat or saw the
form of Jim as it went drifting toward the
cataract. But Jim knew how near he had been
to disaster, and knew that Jennie knew. For
she had seen him turn pale when he came on
the platform to make his address at the farmers&#8217;
meeting at Ames, had seen him begin the
speech he had committed to memory, had observed
how unable he was to remember it, had
noted his confusion as he tried to find his manuscript,
and then his place of beginning in it&mdash;and
when his confusion had seemingly quite
overcome him, had seen him begin talking to
his audience just as he had talked to the political
meeting that time when he had so deeply
offended her, and had observed how he won
first their respect, then their attention, then
apparently their convictions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>To Jennie&#8217;s agitated mind Jim had barely
escaped being drowned in the ocean of his own
unreadiness and confusion under trying conditions.
And she was right. Jim had never felt
more the upstart uneducated farm-hand than
when he was introduced to that audience by
Professor Withers, nor more completely disgraced
than when he concluded his remarks.
Even the applause was to him a kindly effort
on the part of the audience to comfort him in
his failure. His only solace was the look in
Jennie&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; said an old farmer who wore
thick glasses and looked like a Dutch burgomaster,
&#8220;I want to have a little talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Hofmyer of Pottawatomie County,&#8221;
said the dean of the college.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I can
talk to you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;I know Mr. Hofmyer
will excuse you until after dinner. We have
a little party for Mr. Irwin, and we shall be
late if we don&#8217;t hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can I see you after supper?&#8221; asked
Mr. Hofmyer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>Easy it was to satisfy Mr. Hofmyer; and Jim
was carried off to a dinner given by County
Superintendent Jennie to Jim, the dean, Professor
Withers, and one or two others&mdash;and a wonderfully
select and distinguished company it
seemed to Jim. Jennie seized a moment&#8217;s opportunity
to say, &#8220;You did beautifully, Jim;
everybody says so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I failed!&#8221; said. Jim. &#8220;You know I failed.
I couldn&#8217;t remember my speech. I can&#8217;t stay
here feasting. I want to get out in the snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You made the best address of the meeting;
and you did it because you forgot your speech,&#8221;
insisted Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anybody else think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jim! You must learn to believe in
what you have done. Even Con Bonner says
it was the best. He says he didn&#8217;t think you
had it in ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>This advice from her to &#8220;believe in what you
have done,&#8221;&mdash;wasn&#8217;t there something new in
Jennie&#8217;s attitude here? Wasn&#8217;t his belief in
what he was doing precisely the thing which
had made him such a nuisance to the county
superintendent? However, Jim couldn&#8217;t stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
to answer the question which popped up in his
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Professor Withers say?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s delighted&mdash;silly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silly!&#8221; How wonderful it was to be called
&#8220;silly&#8221;&mdash;in that tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have forgotten the speech if it
hadn&#8217;t been for this darned boiled shirt and
collar, and for wearing a cravat,&#8221; urged Jim
in extenuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to &#8217;ve worn them around the
house for a week before coming,&#8221; said Jennie.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ask my advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, next time, Jennie,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t suppose I needed a bitting-rig&mdash;but I
guess I did!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie ran away then to ask Nils Hansen
and Bettina to join their dinner party. She
had a sudden access of friendliness for the
Hansens. Nils refused because he was going
out to see the college herds fed; but at Jennie&#8217;s
urgent request, reinforced by pats and hugs,
Bettina consented. Jennie was very happy, and
proved herself a beaming hostess. The dean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
devoted himself to Bettina&mdash;and Jim found out
afterward that this inquiring gentleman was
getting at the mental processes of a specimen
pupil in one of the new kind of rural schools,
in which he was only half inclined to believe.
He thanked Jim for his speech, and said it was
&#8220;most suggestive and thought-provoking,&#8221; and
as the party broke up slipped into Jim&#8217;s hand
a check for the honorarium. It was not until
then that Jim felt quite sure that he was actually
to be paid for his speech; and he felt a
good deal like returning the check to the conscience
fund of the State of Iowa, if it by any
chance possessed such a fund. But the breach
made in his financial entrenchments by the expenses
of the trip and the respectable and well-fitting
suit of clothes overcame his feeling of
getting something for nothing. If he hadn&#8217;t
given the state anything, he had at least expended
something&mdash;a good deal in fact&mdash;on the
state&#8217;s account.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>JIM&#8217;S WORLD WIDENS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hofmyer was waiting to give Jim
the final convincing proof that he had
produced an effect with his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you teach the kind of school you lay
out in your talk?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and I believe I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer, &#8220;that&#8217;s the kind
of education I b&#8217;lieve in. I kep&#8217; school back
in Pennsylvany fifty years ago, and I made the
scholars measure things, and weigh things, and
apply their studies as fur as I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All good teachers have always done that,&#8221;
said Jim. &#8220;Froebel, Pestalozzi, Colonel Parker&mdash;they
all had the idea which is at the bottom
of my work; &#8216;learn to do by doing,&#8217; and connecting
up the school with life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;h&#8217;m,&#8221; grunted Mr. Hofmyer, &#8220;I hain&#8217;t
been able to see how Latin connects up with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
high-school kid&#8217;s life&mdash;unless he can find a
Latin settlement som&#8217;eres and git a job clerkin&#8217;
in a store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it used to relate to life,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;the
life of the people who made Greek and Latin a
part of everybody else&#8217;s education as well as
their own. Latin and Greek were the only languages
in which anything worth much was
written, you know. But now&#8221;&mdash;Jim spread
out his arms as if to take in the whole world&mdash;&#8220;science,
the marvelous literature of our
tongue in the last three centuries! And to
make a child learn Latin with all that, a thousand
times richer than all the literature of
Latin, lying unused before him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know any Latin?&#8221; asked Mr. Hofmyer.</p>
<p>Jim blushed, as one caught in condemning
what he knows nothing about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I have studied the grammar, and read
<i>Cæsar</i>,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;but that isn&#8217;t much. I
had no teacher, and I had to work pretty hard,
and it didn&#8217;t go very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had all the Latin they gave in the colleges
of my time,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer, &#8220;if I do
talk dialect; and I&#8217;ll agree with you so far as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to say that it would have been a crime for
me to neglect the chemistry, bacteriology, physics,
engineering and other sciences that pertain
to farmin&#8217;&mdash;if there&#8217;d been any such sciences
when I was gettin&#8217; my schoolin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;some people want us
to guide ourselves by the courses of study made
before these sciences existed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, by hokey!&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
be dag-goned if you ain&#8217;t right. I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217;
said so before I heard that speech&mdash;but I say
so now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face lighted up at this, the first convincing
evidence that he had scored.</p>
<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;lieve, too,&#8221; went on Mr. Hofmyer, &#8220;that
your idee would please our folks. I&#8217;ve been the
stand-patter in our parts&mdash;mostly on English
and&mdash;say German. What d&#8217;ye say to comin&#8217;
down and teachin&#8217; our school? We&#8217;ve got a
two-room affair, and I was made a committee
of one to find a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t see how&mdash;&#8221; Jim stammered, all
taken aback by this new breeze of recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t pay much,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
&#8220;You have charge of the dis-<i>cip</i>-line in the
whole school, and teach in Number Two room.
Seventy-five dollars a month. Does it appeal
to ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>Appeal to him! Why, eighteen months ago
it would have been worth crawling across the
state after, and now to have it offered to him&mdash;it
was stupendous. And yet, how about the
Simmses, Colonel Woodruff, the Hansens and
Newton Bronson, now just getting a firm start
on the upward path to usefulness and real happiness?
How could he leave the little, crude,
puny structure on which he had been working&mdash;on
which he had been merely practising&mdash;for
a year, and remove to the new field? Jim
was in exactly the same situation in which
every able young minister of the gospel finds
himself sooner or later. The Lord was calling
to a broader field&mdash;but how could he be sure
it was the Lord?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jim Irwin,
&#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re only &#8217;fraid you can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mr.
Hofmyer, &#8220;think it over. I&#8217;ve got your post-office
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
address on this program, and we&#8217;ll write
you a formal offer. We may spring them figures
a little. Think it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that we&#8217;ve
<i>done</i> all the things I mentioned in my talk, or
that I haven&#8217;t made any mistakes or failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your county superintendent didn&#8217;t mention
any failures,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you talk with her about my work?&#8221; inquired
Jim, suddenly very curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;h&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t see why you want me,&#8221; Jim
went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Mr. Hofmyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not supposed,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that she
had a very high opinion of my work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask her about that,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer,
&#8220;though I guess she thinks well of it. I
asked her what you are tryin&#8217; to do, and what
sort of a fellow you are. I was favorably impressed;
but she didn&#8217;t mention any failures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t succeeded in adopting a successful
system of selling our cream,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;I believe we can do it, but we haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; said Mr. Hofmyer, &#8220;I d&#8217;know as I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
call that a failure. The fact that you&#8217;re tryin&#8217;
of it shows you&#8217;ve got the right idees. We&#8217;ll
write ye, and mebbe pay your way down to
look us over. We&#8217;re a pretty good crowd, the
neighbors think.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THINK OF IT</h3>
</div>

<p>Ames was an inspiration. Jim Irwin received
from the great agricultural college
more real education in this one trip than many
students get from a four years&#8217; course in its
halls; for he had spent ten years in getting
ready for the experience. The great farm of
hundreds of acres, all under the management
of experts, the beautiful campus, the commodious
classrooms and laboratories, and especially
the barns, the greenhouses, gardens,
herds and flocks filled him with a sort of apostolic
joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every school,&#8221; said he to Professor Withers,
&#8220;ought to be doing a good deal of the work
you have to do here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said the professor, &#8220;that much
of our work in agriculture is pretty elementary.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s intermediate school work,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a wrong to force boys and girls to leave
their homes and live in a college to get so much
of what they should have before they&#8217;re ten
years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in what you say,&#8221; said
the professor, &#8220;but some experiment station
men seem to think that agriculture in the common
schools will take from the young men and
women the felt need, and therefore the desire
to come to the college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give them anything better than
high-school work,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that will be so;
but if the science and art of agriculture is what
I think it is, it would make them hungry for the
advanced work that really can&#8217;t be done at
home. To make the children wait until they&#8217;re
twenty is to deny them more than half what
the college ought to give them&mdash;and make them
pay for what they don&#8217;t get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us the kind of schools I ask for,&#8221; cried
Jim, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll fill a college like this in every congressional
district in Iowa, or I&#8217;ll force you to
tear this down and build larger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>The professor laughed at his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>More nearly happy, and rather shorter of
money than he had recently been, Jim journeyed
home among the companions from his
own neighborhood, in a frenzy of plans for the
future. Mr. Hofmyer had dropped from his
mind, until Con Bonner, his old enemy, drew
him aside in the vestibule of the train and
spoke to him in the mysterious manner peculiar
to politicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a proposition did that man
Hofmeister make you?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;He
asked me about you, and I told him you&#8217;re a
crackerjack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged,&#8221; replied Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use in back-cappin&#8217; a fellow that&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to make somethin&#8217; of himself,&#8221; said Bonner.
&#8220;That ain&#8217;t good politics, nor good sense.
Anything to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He offered me a salary of seventy-five dollars
a month to take charge of his school,&#8221; said
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Con, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be sorry to lose yeh,
but you can&#8217;t turn down anything like that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonner scrutinized his face sharply, as if to
find out what sort of game he was playing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, at last, &#8220;I hope you can stay
with us, o&#8217; course. I&#8217;m licked, and I never
squeal. If the rist of the district can stand
your kind of thricks, I can. And say, Jim&#8221;&mdash;here
he grew still more mysterious&mdash;&#8220;if you do
stay, some of us would like to have you be
enough of a Dimmycrat to go into the next con&#8217;vintion
f&#8217;r county superintendent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;I never thought of
such a thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, think of it,&#8221; said Con. &#8220;The county&#8217;s
close, and wid a pop&#8217;lar young educator&mdash;an&#8217; a
farmer, too, it might be done. Think of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Jim was almost
dazed at the number of &#8220;propositions&#8221; of which
he was now required to &#8220;think&#8221;&mdash;and that Bonner&#8217;s
did not at first impress him as having
anything back of it but blarney. He was to
find out later, however, that the wily Con had
made up his mind that the ambition of Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
to serve the rural schools in a larger sphere
might be used for the purpose of bringing to
earth what he regarded as the soaring political
ambitions of the Woodruff family.</p>
<p>To defeat the colonel in the defeat of his
daughter when running for her traditionally-granted
second term; to get Jim Irwin out of
the Woodruff District by kicking him up-stairs
into a county office; to split the forces which
had defeated Mr. Bonner in his own school district;
and to do these things with the very instrument
used by the colonel on that sad but
glorious day of the last school election&mdash;these,
to Mr. Bonner, would be diabolically fine things
to do&mdash;things worthy of those Tammany politicians
who from afar off had won his admiration.</p>
<p>Jim had scarcely taken his seat in the car,
facing Jennie Woodruff and Bettina Hansen in
the Pullman, when Columbus Brown, pathmaster
of the road district and only across the
way from residence in the school district, came
down the aisle and called Jim to the smoking-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did an old fellow named Hoffman from Pottawatomie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
County ask you to leave us and take
his school?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hofmyer,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;&mdash;yes, he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Columbus, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to ask
you to stand in your own light, but I hope you
won&#8217;t let him toll you off there among strangers.
We&#8217;re proud of you, Jim, and we don&#8217;t
want to lose you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proud of him! Sweet music to the underling&#8217;s
ears! Jim blushed and stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; said Columbus, &#8220;I know that
Woodruff District job hain&#8217;t big enough for
you any more; but we can make it bigger. If
you&#8217;ll stay, I believe we can pull off a deal to
consolidate some of them districts, and make
you boss of the whole shooting match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate this, Clumb,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;but I
don&#8217;t believe you can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, think of it,&#8221; said Columbus. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t do anything till you talk with me and a
few of the rest of the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it&#8221; again!</p>
<p>A fine home-coming it was for Jim, with the
colonel waiting at the station with a double
sleigh, and the chance to ride into the snowy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
country in the same seat with Jennie&mdash;a chance
which was blighted by the colonel&#8217;s placing of
Jennie, Bettina and Nils Hansen in the broad
rear seat, and Jim in front with himself. A
fine ride, just the same, over fine roads, and
past fine farmsteads snuggled into their rectangular
wrappages of trees set out in the old
pioneer days. The colonel would not allow him
to get out and walk when he could really have
reached home more quickly by doing so; no, he
set the Hansens down at their door, took Jennie
home, and then drove the lightened sleigh
merrily to the humble cabin of the rather excited
young schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you make any deal with those people
down in the western part of the state?&#8221; asked
the colonel. &#8220;Jennie wrote me that you&#8217;ve got
an offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jim, and he told the colonel about
the proposal of Mr. Hofmyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;in my capacity of
wild-eyed reformer, I&#8217;ve made up my mind that
the first four miles in the trip is to make the
rural teacher&#8217;s job a bigger job. It&#8217;s got to
be a man&#8217;s size, woman&#8217;s size job, or we can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
get real men and real women to stay in the
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a statesmanlike formulation
of it,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;don&#8217;t turn down
the Pottawatomie County job until we have a
chance to see what we can do. I&#8217;ll get some
kind of a meeting together, and what I want
you to do is to use this offer as a club over
this helpless school district. What we need is
to be held up. Do the Jesse James act, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, Colonel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can, too. Will you try it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to treat everybody fairly,&#8221; said Jim,
&#8220;including Mr. Hofmyer. I don&#8217;t know what
to do, hardly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get the meeting together,&#8221; said
the colonel, &#8220;and in the meantime, think of
what I&#8217;ve said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another thing to think of! Jim rushed into
the house and surprised his mother, who had
expected him to arrive after a slow walk from
town through the snow. Jim caught her in
his arms, from which she was released a moment
later, quite flustered and blushing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, James,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you seem excited.
What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, mother,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;except that
I believe there&#8217;s just a possibility of my being a
success in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, my boy!&#8221; said she, laying her hand
on his arm, &#8220;if you were to die to-night, you&#8217;d
die the greatest success any boy ever was&mdash;if
your mother is any judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim kissed her, and went up to his attic to
change his clothes. Inside the waistcoat was
a worn envelope, which he carefully opened,
and took from it a letter much creased from
many foldings. It was the old letter from Jennie,
written when the comical mistake had been
made of making him the teacher of the Woodruff
school. It still contained her rather fussy
cautions about being &#8220;too original,&#8221; and the
sage statement that &#8220;the wheel runs easiest in
the beaten track.&#8221; It was written before the
vexation and trouble he had caused her; but he
did not read the advice, nor think of the coolness
which had come between them&mdash;he read
only the sentence in which Jennie had told of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
her father&#8217;s interest in Jim&#8217;s success, ending
with the underscored words, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;m for you, too.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Jim, as he went out to do
the evening&#8217;s tasks, &#8220;I wonder if she <i>is</i> for
me!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A SCHOOL DISTRICT HELD UP</h3>
</div>

<p>Young McGeehee Simms was loitering
along the snowy way to the schoolhouse
bearing a brightly scoured tin pail two-thirds
full of water. He had been allowed to act as
Water Superintendent of the Woodruff School
as a reward of merit&mdash;said merit being an essay
on which he received credit in both language
and geography on &#8220;Harvesting Wheat in the
Tennessee Mountains.&#8221; This had been of vast
interest to the school in view of the fact that the
Simmses were the only pupils in the school
who had ever seen in use that supposedly-obsolete
harvesting implement, the cradle.
Buddy&#8217;s essay had been passed over to the class
in United States history as the evidence of an
eye-witness concerning farming conditions in
our grandfathers&#8217; times.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>The surnameless Pete, Colonel Woodruff&#8217;s
hired man, halted Buddy at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Simms, I believe?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you must be lookin&#8217; for my
brother, Raymond, suh,&#8221; said Buddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a-lookin&#8217;,&#8221; said Pete impressively,
&#8220;for Mr. McGeehee Simms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; said Buddy; &#8220;but I hain&#8217;t been
doin&#8217; nothin&#8217; wrong, suh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a message here,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;for Professor
James E. Irwin. He&#8217;s what-ho within,
there, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s inside, I reckon,&#8221; said Buddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then will you be so kind and condescendin&#8217;
as to stoop so low as to jump so high as to
give him this letter?&#8221; asked Pete.</p>
<p>Buddy took the letter and was considering
of his reply to this remarkable speech, when
Pete, gravely saluting, passed on, rather congratulating
himself on having staged a very
good burlesque of the dignified manners of
those queer mountaineers, the Simmses.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Please come to the meeting to-night,&#8221; ran
the colonel&#8217;s note to Jim; &#8220;and when you come,
come prepared to hold the district up. If we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
can&#8217;t meet the Pottawatomie County standard
of wages, we ought to lose you. Everybody in
the district will be there. Come late, so you
won&#8217;t hear yourself talked about&mdash;I should recommend
nine-thirty and war-paint.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>It was a crisis, no doubt of that; and the responsibility
of the situation rather sickened
Jim of the task of teaching. How could he
impose conditions on the whole school district?
How could the colonel expect such a thing of
him? And how could any one look for anything
but scorn for the upstart field-hand from
these men who had for so many years made
him the butt of their good-natured but none
the less contemptuous ridicule? Who was he,
anyway, to lay down rules for these substantial
and successful men&mdash;he who had been for
all the years of his life at their command, subservient
to their demands for labor&mdash;their underling?
Only one thing kept him from dodging
the whole issue and remaining at home&mdash;the
colonel&#8217;s matter-of-fact assumption that
Jim had become master of the situation. How
could he flee, when this old soldier was fighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
so valiantly for him in the trenches? So Jim
went to the meeting.</p>
<p>The season was nearing spring, and it was
a mild thawy night. The windows of the
schoolhouse were filled with heads, evidencing
the presence of a crowd of almost unprecedented
size, and the sashes had been thrown
up for ventilation and coolness. As Jim
climbed the back fence of the school-yard, he
heard a burst of applause, from which he
judged that some speaker had just finished his
remarks. There was silence when he came
alongside the window at the right of the chairman&#8217;s
desk, a silence broken by the voice of
Old Man Simms, saying &#8220;Mistah Chairman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chair,&#8221; said the voice of Ezra Bronson,
&#8220;recognizes Mr. Simms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim halted in indecision. He was not expected
while the debate was in progress, and
therefore regarded himself at this time as
somewhat <i>de trop</i>. There is no rule of manners
or morals, however, forbidding eavesdropping
during the proceedings of a public meeting&mdash;and
anyhow, he felt rather shiveringly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
curious about these deliberations. Therefore
he listened to the first and last public speech
of Old Man Simms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah ain&#8217;t no speaker,&#8221; said Old Man Simms,
&#8220;but Ah cain&#8217;t set here and be quiet an&#8217; go
home an&#8217; face my ole woman an&#8217; my boys an&#8217;
gyuhls withouten sayin&#8217; a word fo&#8217; the best
friend any family evah had, Mr. Jim Irwin.&#8221;
(Applause.) &#8220;Ah owe it to him that Ah&#8217;ve
got the right to speak in this meetin&#8217; at all.
Gentlemen, we-all owe everything to Mr. Jim
Irwin! Maybe Ah&#8217;ll be thought forrard to
speak hyah, bein&#8217; as Ah ain&#8217;t no learnin&#8217; an&#8217;
some may think Ah don&#8217;t pay no taxes; but it
will be overlooked, I reckon, seein&#8217; as how we&#8217;ve
took the Blanchard farm, a hundred an&#8217; sixty
acres, for five yeahs, an&#8217; move in a week from
Sat&#8217;day. We pay taxes in our rent, Ah reckon,
an&#8217; howsomever that may be, Ah&#8217;ve come to
feel that you-all won&#8217;t think hard of me if Ah
speak what we-uns feel so strong about Mr.
Jim Irwin?&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Man Simms finished this exordium with
the rising inflection, which denoted a direct
question as to his status in the meeting. &#8220;Go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
on!&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got as good a right as any one!&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, old man!&#8221; Such exclamations
as these came to Jim&#8217;s ears with scarcely
less gratefulness than to those of Old Man
Simms&mdash;who stammered and went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah thank you-all kindly. Gentlemen an&#8217;
ladies, when Mr. Jim Irwin found us, we was
scandalous pore, an&#8217; we was wuss&#8217;n pore&mdash;we
was low-down.&#8221; (Cries of &#8220;No&mdash;No!&#8221;) &#8220;Yes,
we was, becuz what&#8217;s respectable in the mountings
is one thing, whar all the folks is pore,
but when a man gets in a new place, he&#8217;s got
to lift himse&#8217;f up to what folks does where
he&#8217;s come to, or he&#8217;ll fall to the bottom of what
there is in that there community&mdash;an&#8217; maybe
he&#8217;ll make a place fer himse&#8217;f lower&#8217;n anybody
else. In the mountings we was good people,
becuz we done the best we could an&#8217; the best
any one done; but hyah, we was low-down
people becuz we hated the people that had mo&#8217;
learnin&#8217;, mo&#8217; land, mo&#8217; money, an&#8217; mo&#8217; friends
than what we had. My little gyuhls wasn&#8217;t
respectable in their clothes. My childern was
igernant, an&#8217; triflin&#8217;, but I was the most triflin&#8217;
of all. Ah&#8217;ll leave it to Colonel Woodruff if I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
was good fer a plug of terbacker, or a bakin&#8217; of
flour at any sto&#8217; in the county. Was I, Colonel?
Wasn&#8217;t I perfectly wuthless an&#8217; triflin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a ripple of laughter, in the midst
of which the colonel&#8217;s voice was heard saying,
&#8220;I guess you were, Mr. Simms, I guess you
were, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee,&#8221; said Old Man Simms, as if the
colonel had given a really valuable testimonial
to his character. &#8220;I sho&#8217; was! Thankee
kindly! An&#8217;now, what am I good fer? Cain&#8217;t
I get anything I want at the stores? Cain&#8217;t I
git a little money at the bank, if I got to
have it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just as good as any man in the district,&#8221;
said the colonel. &#8220;You don&#8217;t ask for
more than you can pay, and you can get all
you ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankee,&#8221; said Mr. Simms gravely. &#8220;What
Ah tell you-all is right, ladies and gentlemen.
An&#8217; what has made the change in we-uns, ladies
and gentlemen? It&#8217;s the wuk of Mr. Jim
Irwin with my boy Raymond, the best boy any
man evah hed, and my gyuhl, Calista, an&#8217;
Buddy, an&#8217; Jinnie, an&#8217; with me an&#8217; my ole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
woman. He showed us how to get a toe-holt
into this new kentry. He teached the children
what orto be did by a rentin&#8217; farmer in Ioway.
He done lifted us up, an&#8217; made people of us.
He done showed us that you-all is good people,
an&#8217; not what we thought you was. Outen what
he learned in school, my boy Raymond an&#8217; me
made as good crops as we could last summer,
an&#8217; done right much wuk outside. We got the
name of bein&#8217; good farmers an&#8217; good wukkers,
an&#8217; when Mr. Blanchard moved to town, he said
he was glad to give us his fine farm for five
years. Now, see what Mr. Jim Irwin has done
for a pack o&#8217; outlaws and outcasts. Instid o&#8217;
hidin&#8217; out from the Hobdays that was lay-wayin&#8217;
us in the mountings, we&#8217;ll be livin&#8217; in a
house with two chimleys an&#8217; a swimmin&#8217; tub
made outen crock&#8217;ryware. We&#8217;ll be in debt a
whole lot&mdash;an&#8217; we owe it to Mr. Jim Irwin that
we got the credit to git in debt with, an&#8217; the
courage to go on and git out agin!&#8221; (Applause.)
&#8220;Ah could affo&#8217;d to pay Mr. Jim Irwin&#8217;s
salary mysr&#8217;f, if Ah could. An&#8217; there&#8217;s
enough men hyah to-night that say they&#8217;ve been
money-he&#8217;ped by his teachin&#8217; the school to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
make up mo&#8217; than his wages. Let&#8217;s not let Mr.
Jim Irwin go, neighbors! Let&#8217;s not let him
go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s heart sank. Surely the case was desperate
which could call forth such a forlorn-hope
charge as that of Old Man Simms&mdash;a performance
on Mr. Simms&#8217; part which warmed
Jim&#8217;s soul. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a man in that meeting,&#8221;
said he to himself, as he walked to the
schoolhouse door, &#8220;possessed of the greatness
of spirit of Old Man Simms. If he&#8217;s a fair
sample of the people of the mountains, they are
of the stuff of which great nations are made&mdash;if
they only are given a chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff was on his feet as Jim
made his way through the crowd about the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Irwin is here, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and I move that we hear from him as
to what we can do to meet the offer of our
friends in Pottawatomie County, who have
heard of his good work, and want him to work
for them; but before I yield the floor, I want
to say that this meeting has been worth while
just to have been the occasion of our all becoming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
better acquainted with our friend and
neighbor, Mr. Simms. Whatever may have
been the lack of understanding, on our part,
of his qualities, they were all cleared up by
that speech of his&mdash;the best I have ever heard
in this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>More applause, in the midst of which Old
Man Simms slunk away down in his seat to escape
observation. Then the chairman said that
if there was no objection they would hear from
their well-known citizen, whose growing fame
was more remarkable for the fact that it had
been gained as a country schoolmaster&mdash;he need
not add that he referred to Mr. James E. Irwin.
More and louder applause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends and neighbors,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;you ask
me to say to you what I want you to do. I
want you to do what you want to do&mdash;nothing
more nor less. Last year I was glad to be tolerated
here; and the only change in the situation
lies in the fact that I have another place
offered me&mdash;unless there has been a change in
your feelings toward me and my work. I hope
there has been; for I know my work is good
now, whereas I only believed it then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it is!&#8221; shouted Con Bonner from a
front seat, thus signalizing that astute wire-puller&#8217;s
definite choice of a place in the bandwagon.
&#8220;Tell us what you want, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I want?&#8221; asked Jim. &#8220;More than
anything else, I want such meetings as this&mdash;often&mdash;and
a place to hold them. If I stay in
the Woodruff District, I want this meeting to
effect a permanent organization to work with
me. I can&#8217;t teach this district anything. Nobody
can teach any one anything. All any
teacher can do is to direct people&#8217;s activities
in teaching themselves. You are gathered here
to decide what you&#8217;ll do about the small matter
of keeping me at work as your hired man. You
can&#8217;t make any legal decision here, but whatever
this meeting decides will be law, just the
same, because a majority of the people of the
district are here. Such a meeting as this can
decide almost anything. If I&#8217;m to be your
hired man, I want a boss in the shape of a
civic organization which will take in every man
and woman in the district. Here&#8217;s the place
and now&#8217;s the time to make that organization&mdash;an
organization the object of which shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
to put the whole district at school, and to boss
me in my work for the whole district.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat sounds good,&#8221; cried Haakon Peterson.
&#8220;Ve&#8217;ll do dat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I want you to work out a building
scheme for the school,&#8221; Jim went on. &#8220;We
want a place where the girls can learn to cook,
keep house, take care of babies, sew and learn
to be wives and mothers. We want a place in
which Mrs. Hansen can come to show them how
to cure meat&mdash;she&#8217;s the best hand at that in
the county&mdash;where Mrs. Bonner can teach them
to make bread and pastry&mdash;she ought to be
given a doctor&#8217;s degree for that&mdash;where Mrs.
Woodruff can teach them the cooking of turkeys,
Mrs. Peterson the way to give the family
a balanced ration, and Mrs. Simms induct them
into the mysteries of weaving rag rugs and
making jellies and preserves&mdash;you can all learn
these things from her. There&#8217;s somebody right
in this neighborhood able to teach anything the
young people want to learn.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want a physician here once in a
while to examine the children as to their health,
and a dentist to look after their teeth and teach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
them how to care for them. Also an oculist to
examine their eyes. And when Bettina Hansen
comes home from the hospital a trained
nurse, I want her to have a job as visiting nurse
right here in the Woodruff District.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a counting-room for the keeping of
the farm accounts and the record of our observation
in farming. I want cooperation in
letting us have these accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want some manual training equipment for
wood-working and metal working, and a blacksmith
and wagon shop, in which the boys may
learn to shoe horses, repair tools, design buildings,
and practise the best agricultural engineering.
So I want a blacksmith and handyman
with tools regularly on the job&mdash;and he&#8217;ll
more than pay his way. I want some land for
actual farming. I want to do work in poultry
according to the most modern breeding discoveries,
and I want your cooperation in that,
and a poultry plant somewhere in the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a laboratory in which we can work
on seeds, pests, soils, feeds and the like. For
the education of your children must come out
of these things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want these things because they are necessary
if we are to get the culture out of life we
should get&mdash;and nobody gets culture out of any
sort of school&mdash;they get it out of life, or they
don&#8217;t get it at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I want you to build as freely for your
school as for your cattle and horses and hogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The school I ask for will make each of you
more money than the taxes it will require
would make if invested in your farm equipment.
If you are not convinced of this, don&#8217;t
bother with me any longer. But the money
the school will make for you&mdash;this new kind
of rural school&mdash;will be as nothing to the social
life which will grow up&mdash;a social life
which will make necessary an assembly-room,
which will be the social center, because it will
be the educational center, and the business center
of the countryside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want all these things, and more. But I
don&#8217;t expect them all at once. I know that
this district is too small to do all of them, and
therefore, I am going to tell you of another
want which will tempt you to think that I am
crazy. I want a bigger district&mdash;one that will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
give us the financial strength to carry out the
program I have sketched. This may be a presumptuous
thing for me to propose; but the
whole situation here to-night is presumptuous
on my part, I fear. If you think so, let me
go; but if you don&#8217;t, please keep this meeting
together in a permanent organization of grown-up
members of the Woodruff school, and by
pulling together, you can do these things&mdash;all
of them&mdash;and many more&mdash;and you&#8217;ll make the
Woodruff District a good place to live in and
die in&mdash;and I shall be proud to live and die
in it at your service, as the neighborhood&#8217;s hired
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Jim sat down there was a hush in the
crowded room, as if the people were dazed at
his assurance. There was no applause, until
Jennie Woodruff, now seen by Jim for the first
time over next the blackboard, clapped her
gloved hands together and started it; then it
swept out through the windows in a storm. The
dust rose from stamping feet until the kerosene
lamps were dimmed by it. And as the
noise subsided, Jim saw standing out in front
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the stooped form of B. B. Hamm, one of the
most prosperous men in the district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Chairman&mdash;Ezra Bronson,&#8221; he roared,
&#8220;this feller&#8217;s crazy, an&#8217; from the sound of
things, you&#8217;re all as crazy as he is. If this fool
scheme of his goes through, my farm&#8217;s for sale!
I&#8217;ll quit before I&#8217;m sold out for taxes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute, B. B.!&#8221; interposed Colonel
Woodruff. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t as dangerous as you
think. You don&#8217;t want us to do all this in fifteen
minutes, do you, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, as to that,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;I just wanted
you to have in your minds what I have in my
mind&mdash;and unless we can agree to work toward
these things there&#8217;s no use in my staying. But
time&mdash;that&#8217;s another matter. Believe with me,
and I&#8217;ll work with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of here!&#8221; said the colonel to Jim
in an undertone, &#8220;and leave the rest to your
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim walked out of the room and took the way
toward his home. A horse tied to the hitching-pole
had his blanket under foot, and Jim
replaced it on his back, patting him kindly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
talking horse language to him. Then he went
up and down the line of teams, readjusting
blankets, tying loosened knots, and assuring
himself that his neighbors&#8217; horses were securely
tied and comfortable. He knew horses
better than he knew people, he thought. If he
could manage people as he could manage horses&mdash;but
that would be wrong. The horse did his
work as a servant, submissive to the wills of
others; the community could never develop anything
worth while in its common life, until it
worked the system out for itself. Horse management
was despotism; man-government must
be like the government of a society of wild
horses, the result of the common work of the
members of the herd.</p>
<p>Two figures emerged from the schoolhouse
door, and as he turned toward his home after
his pastoral calls on the horses, they overtook
him. They were the figures of Newton Bronson
and the county superintendent of schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were coming after you,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad wants you back there again,&#8221; said
Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; inquired Jim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You silly boy,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;you talked
about the good of the schools all of the time,
and never said a word about your own salary!
What do you want? They want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Jim in the manner of one
who suddenly remembers that he has forgotten
his umbrella or his pocket-knife. &#8220;I forgot all
about it. I haven&#8217;t thought about that at all,
Jennie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you need a guardian!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Jennie,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I know
who I want. I want&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please come back,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;and tell
papa how much you&#8217;re going to hold the district
up for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You run back,&#8221; said Jim to Newton, &#8220;and
tell your father that whatever is right in the
way of salary will be satisfactory to me. I
leave that to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newton darted off, leaving the schoolmaster
standing in the road with the county superintendent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go back there!&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, Jim,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;This
community has found its master. They can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
do all you ask now, nor very soon; but finally
they&#8217;ll do just as you want them to do. And,
Jim, I want to say that I&#8217;ve been the biggest
little fool in the county!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AN EMBASSY FROM DIXIE</h3>
</div>

<p>Superintendent Jennie sat at her
desk in no very satisfactory frame of mind.
In the first place court was to convene on the
following Monday, and both grand jury and
petit juries would be in session, so that her
one-room office was not to be hers for a few
days. Her desk was even now ready to be
moved into the hall by the janitor. To Wilbur
Smythe, who did her the honor of calling occasionally
as the exigencies of his law practise
took him past the office of the pretty country
girl on whose shapely shoulders rested the burden
of the welfare of the schools, she remarked
that if they didn&#8217;t soon build the new court-house
so as to give her such accommodations
as her office really needed, &#8220;they might take
their old office&mdash;so there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair woman,&#8221; said Wilbur, as he creased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
his Prince Albert in a parting bow, &#8220;should
adorn the home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; sneered Jennie, rather pleased, all
the same, &#8220;suppose she isn&#8217;t fair, and hasn&#8217;t
any home!&#8221;</p>
<p>This question of adorning a home was no
nearer settlement with Jennie than it had ever
been, though increasingly a matter of speculation.</p>
<p>There were two or three men&mdash;rather good
catches, too&mdash;who, if they were encouraged&mdash;but
what was there to any of them? Take Wilbur
Smythe, now; he would by sheer force of
persistent assurance and fair abilities eventually
get a good practise for a country lawyer&mdash;three
or four thousand a year&mdash;serve in the
legislature or the state senate, and finally become
a bank director with a goodly standing
as a safe business man; but what was there
to him? This is what Jennie asked her paper-weight
as she placed it on a pile of unfinished
examination papers. And the paper-weight
echoed, &#8220;Not a thing out of the ordinary!&#8221; And
then, said Jennie, &#8220;Well, you little simpleton,
who and what are <i>you</i> so out of the ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
that you should sneer at Wilbur Smythe and
Beckman Fifield and such men?&#8221; And echo
answered, &#8220;What?&#8221;&mdash;and then the mail-carrier
came in.</p>
<p>Down near the bottom of the pile she found
this letter, signed by a southern state superintendent
of schools, but dated at Kirksville,
Missouri:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I am a member of a party of southern educators&mdash;state
superintendents in the main,&#8221; the
letter ran, &#8220;<i>en tour</i> of the country to see what
we can find of an instructive nature in rural
school work. I assure you that we are being
richly repaid for the time and expense. There
are things going on in the schools here in northeastern
Missouri, for instance, which merit
much study. We have met Professor Withers,
of Ames, who suggests that we visit your
schools, and especially the rural school taught
by a young man named Irwin, and I wonder if
you will be free on next Monday morning, if
we come to your office, to direct us to the
place? If you could accompany us on the trip,
and perhaps show us some of your other excellent
schools, we should be honored and
pleased. The South is recreating her rural
schools, and we are coming to believe that we
shall be better workmen if we create a new
kind rather than an improvement of the old
kind.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>There was more of this courteous and deferential
letter, all giving Jennie a sense of being
saluted by a fine gentleman in satin and ruffles,
and with a plume on his hat. And then came
the shock&mdash;a party of state officials were coming
into the county to study Jim Irwin&#8217;s school!
They would never come to study Wilbur
Smythe&#8217;s law practise&mdash;never in the world&mdash;or
her work as county superintendent&mdash;never!&mdash;and
Jim was getting seventy-five dollars a
month, and had a mother to support. Moreover,
he was getting more than he had asked
when the colonel had told him to &#8220;hold the district
up!&#8221; But there could be no doubt that
there was something <i>to</i> Jim&mdash;the man was out
of the ordinary. And wasn&#8217;t that just what
she had been looking for in her mind?</p>
<p>Jennie wired to her southerner for the number
of his party, and secured automobiles for
the trip. She sent a note to Jim Irwin telling
of the prospective visitation. She would show
all concerned that she could do some things,
anyhow, and she would send these people on
with a good impression of her county.</p>
<p>She was glad of the automobiles the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Monday morning, when at nine-thirty the train
discharged upon her a dozen very alert, very
up-to-date, very inquisitive southerners, male
and female, most of whom seemed to have left
their &#8220;r&#8217;s&#8221; in the gulf region. It was eleven
when the party parked their machines before
the schoolhouse door.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are visitors here before us,&#8221; said
Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems rather like an educational shrine,&#8221;
said Doctor Brathwayt, of Mississippi. &#8220;How
does he accommodate so many visitors in that
small edifice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not aware,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;that he has
been in the habit of receiving so very many
from outside the district. Well, shall we
go in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once inside, Jennie felt a queer return of
her old aversion to Jim&#8217;s methods&mdash;the aversion
which had caused her to criticize him so
sharply on the occasion of her first visit. The
reason for the return of the feeling lay in the
fact that the work going on was of the same
sort, but of a more intense character. It was
so utterly unlike a school as Jennie understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
the word, that she glanced back at the group
of educators with a little blush. The school
was in a sort of uproar. Not that uproar of
boredom and mischief of which most of us have
familiar memories, but a sort of eager uproar,
in which every child was intensely interested
in the same thing; and did little rustling things
because of this interest; something like the
hum at a football game or a dog-fight.</p>
<p>On one side of the desk stood Jim Irwin, and
facing him was a smooth stranger of the old-fashioned
lightning-rod-agent type&mdash;the shallower
and laxer sort of salesman of the kind
whose sole business is to get signatures on the
dotted line, and let some one else do the rest.
In short, he was a &#8220;closer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing back of him in evident distress was
Mr. Cornelius Bonner, and grouped about were
Columbus Brown, B. B. Hamm, Ezra Bronson,
A. B. Talcott and two or three others from
outside the Woodruff District. With envelopes
in their hands and the light of battle in their
eyes stood Newton Bronson, Raymond Simms,
Bettina Hansen, Mary Smith and Angie Talcott,
the boys filled with delight, the girls rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
frightened at being engaged in something like
a debate with the salesman.</p>
<p>As the latest-coming visitors moved forward,
they heard the schoolmaster finishing his passage
at arms with the salesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not feel exasperated at us, Mr.
Carmichael,&#8221; said he in tones of the most complete
respect, &#8220;for what our figures show. You
are unfortunate in the business proposition you
offer this community. That is all. Even these
children have the facts to prove that the
creamery outfit you offer is not worth within
two thousand dollars of what you ask for it,
and that it is very doubtful if it is the sort
of outfit we should need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you a thousand dollars&mdash;&#8221; began
Carmichael hotly, when Jim waved him down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with me,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Your friend, Mr.
Bonner, there, knows what chance there is for
you to bet even a thousand cents with me. Besides,
we know our facts, in this school. We&#8217;ve
been working on them for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet your life we have!&#8221; interpolated Newton
Bronson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we finish,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;I want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
thank you gentlemen for bringing in Mr. Carmichael.
We have been reading up on the literature
of the creamery promoter, and it is a
very fine thing to have one in the flesh with
whom to&mdash;to&mdash;demonstrate, if Mr. Carmichael
will allow me to say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmichael looked at Bonner, made an expressive
motion with his head toward the door,
and turned as if to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I can do plenty of business
with <i>men</i>. If you <i>men</i> want to make the
deal I offer you, and I can show you from the
statistics I&#8217;ve got at the hotel that it&#8217;s a special
deal just to get started in this part of the
state, and carries a thousand dollars of cut in
price to you. Let&#8217;s leave these children and
this he school-ma&#8217;am and get something done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow you to depart,&#8221; said Jim more
gently than before, &#8220;without thanking you for
the very excellent talk you gave us on the advantage
of the cooperative creamery over the
centralizer. We in this school believe in the
cooperative creamery, and if we can get rid
of you, Mr. Carmichael, without buying your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
equipment, I think your work here may be productive
of good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off three or four points on the average
overrun in the Wisconsin co-ops,&#8221; said Newton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we thought,&#8221; said Mary Smith, &#8220;that
we&#8217;d need more cows than he said to keep up
a creamery of our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;but we mustn&#8217;t expect
Mr. Carmichael to know the subject as well as
we do, children. He makes a practise of talking
mostly to people who know nothing about
it&mdash;and he talks very well. All in favor of
thanking Mr. Carmichael please say &#8216;Aye.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rousing chorus of &#8220;Aye!&#8221; in
which Mr. Carmichael, followed closely by Mr.
Bonner, made his exit. B. B. Hamm went forward
and shook Jim&#8217;s hand slowly and contemplatively,
as if trying to remember just
what he should say.</p>
<p>&#8220;James E. Irwin,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;ve saved us
from being skinned by the smoothest grafter
that I ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Jim; &#8220;the kind of school I
stand for, Mr. Hamm, will save you more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
that&mdash;and give you the broadest culture any
school ever gave. A culture based on life.
We&#8217;ve been studying life, in this school&mdash;the
life we all live here in this district.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a smooth partner, too,&#8221; said Columbus
Brown. Jim looked at Bonner&#8217;s little
boy in one of the front seats and shook his
head at Columbus warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t herded &#8217;em in here to ask you
a few questions about cooperative creameries,&#8221;
said Mr. Talcott, &#8220;we&#8217;d have been stuck&mdash;they
pretty near had our names. And then the
whole neighborhood would have been sucked in
for about fifty dollars a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have gone in for two hundred,&#8221; said
B. B. Hamm.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I call a little meeting here for a minute,
Jim?&#8221; asked Ezra Bronson. &#8220;Why, where&#8217;s
he gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s some other visitors come in,&#8221; said a
little girl, pulling her apron in embarrassment
at the teacher&#8217;s absence.</p>
<p>Jim had, after what seemed to Jennie an
interminable while, seen the county superintendent
and her distinguished party, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
now engaged in welcoming them and endeavoring
to find them seats,&mdash;quite an impossible
thing at that particular moment, by the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind us, Mr. Irwin,&#8221; said Doctor
Brathwayt. &#8220;This is the best thing we&#8217;ve seen
on our journeyings. Please go on with the
proceedin&#8217;s. That gentleman seems to have in
mind the perfectin&#8217; of some so&#8217;t of organization.
I&#8217;m intensely interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to call a little meetin&#8217; here,&#8221; said
Ezra to the teacher. &#8220;Seein&#8217; we&#8217;ve busted up
your program so far, may we take a little while
longer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;The school will
please come to order.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pupils took their seats, straightened
their books and papers, and were at attention.
Doctor Brathwayt nodded approvingly as if at
the answer to some question in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children,&#8221; said Mr. Irwin, &#8220;you may or may
not be interested in what these gentlemen are
about to do&mdash;but I hope you are. Those who
wish may be members of Mr. Bronson&#8217;s meeting.
Those who do not prefer to do so may
take up their regular work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Mr. Bronson to the remains
of Mr. Carmichael&#8217;s creamery party,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been cutting bait in this neighborhood
about long enough. I&#8217;m in favor of fishing,
now. It would have been the biggest disgrace
ever put on this district to have been swindled
by that sharper, when the man that could have
set us right on the subject was right here working
for us, and we never let him have a chance.
And yet that&#8217;s what we pretty near did. How
many here favor building a cooperative creamery
if we can get the farmers in with cows
enough to make it profitable, and the equipment
at the right price?&#8221;</p>
<p>Each man held up a hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s one of our best farmers not voting,&#8221;
said Mr. Bronson, indicating Raymond Simms.
&#8220;How about you, Raymond?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah reckon paw&#8217;ll come in,&#8221; said Raymond
blushingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will if you say so,&#8221; said Mr. Bronson.</p>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s hand went up amid a ripple of
applause from the pupils, who seemed glad to
have a voter in their ranks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unanimous!&#8221; said Mr. Bronson. &#8220;It is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
vote! Now I&#8217;d like to hear a motion to perfect
a permanent organization to build a creamery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to have a secretary first,&#8221;
said Mr. Talcott, &#8220;and I nominate Mr. James
E. Irwin for the post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite correct,&#8221; said Mr. Bronson, &#8220;thankee,
A. B. I was about to forgit the secretary. Any
other nominations? No &#8217;bjections, Mr. Irwin
will be declared unanimously elected. Mr. Irwin&#8217;s
elected. Mr. Irwin, will you please assume
the duties?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim sat down at the desk and began making
notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to call this the Anti-Carmichael
Protective Association,&#8221; said Columbus
Brown, but Mr. Bronson interrupted him,
rather frowningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All in good time, Clumb,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but this
is serious work.&#8221; So admonished, the meeting
appointed committees, fixed upon a time for a
future meeting, threw a collection of half-dollars
on the desk to start a petty cash fund,
made the usual joke about putting the secretary
under bond, adjourned and dispersed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a go this time!&#8221; said Newton to Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;with those men interested.
Well, our study of creameries has
given a great deal of language work, a good
deal of arithmetic, some geography, and finally
saved the people from a swindle. Rather good
work, Raymond!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother has a delayed luncheon ready
for the party,&#8221; said Jennie to Jim. &#8220;Please
come with us&mdash;please!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jim demurred. Getting off at this time
of day was really out of the question if he was
to be ready to show the real work of the school
in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been rather extraordinary,&#8221; said
Jim, &#8220;but I am very glad you were here. It
shows the utility of the right sort of work in
letter-writing, language, geography and arithmetic&mdash;in
learning things about farming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly does,&#8221; said Doctor Brathwayt.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have missed it under any consideration;
but I&#8217;m certainly sorry for that
creamery shark and his accomplice&mdash;to be
routed by the Fifth Reader grade in farming!&#8221;</p>
<p>The luncheon was rather a wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
affair&mdash;and its success was unqualified after everybody
discovered that the majority of those in
attendance felt much more at home when calling
it dinner. Colonel Woodruff had fought
against the regiment of the father of Professor
Gray, of Georgia, in at least one engagement,
and tentative plans were laid for the
meeting of the two old veterans &#8220;some winter
in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye think of our school?&#8221; asked the
colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Professor Gray, &#8220;it&#8217;s not fair to
judge, Colonel, on what must have been rather
an extraordinary moment in the school&#8217;s history.
I take it that you don&#8217;t put on a representation
of &#8216;The Knave Unmasked&#8217; every
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was more like a caucus than I&#8217;ve ever
seen it, daddy,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;and less like a
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8221; said Doctor Brathwayt,
&#8220;that it was less like a school because it was
more like life? It <i>was</i> life. If I am not mistaken,
history for this community was making
in that schoolroom as we entered.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly right, Doctor,&#8221; said the
colonel. &#8220;Columbus Brown and about a dozen
others living outside the district are calling
Wilbur Smythe in counsel to perfect plans for
an election to consolidate a few of these little
independent districts, for the express purpose
of giving Jim Irwin a plant that he can do
something with. Jim&#8217;s got too big for the district,
and so we&#8217;re going to enlarge the district,
and the schoolhouse, and the teaching force,
and the means of educational grace generally.
That&#8217;s as sure as can be&mdash;after what took place
this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rather a wonderful person, to be found
in such a position,&#8221; said Professor Gray, &#8220;or
would be in any region I have visited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a native product,&#8221; said the colonel,
&#8220;but a wonder all the same. He&#8217;s a Brown
Mouse, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a&mdash;?&#8221; Doctor Brathwayt was plainly
astonished. And so the colonel was allowed to
tell again the story of the Darbishire brown
mice, and why he called Jim Irwin one. Doctor
Brathwayt said it was an interesting Mendelian
explanation of the appearance of such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
a character as Jim. &#8220;And if you are right,
Colonel, you&#8217;ll lose him one of these days. You
can&#8217;t expect to retain a Cæsar, a Napoleon, or
a Lincoln in a rural school, can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said the colonel.
&#8220;The great opportunity for such a Brown
Mouse may be in this very school, right now.
He&#8217;d have as big an army right here as Socrates
ever had. The Brown Mouse is the only
judge of his own proper place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Mrs. Brathwayt, as they motored
back to the school, &#8220;that your country
schoolmaster is rather terrible. The way he
crushed that Mr. Carmichael was positively
merciless. Did he know how cruel he was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;It was the truth
that crushed Mr. Carmichael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that vote of thanks,&#8221; said Mrs. Brathwayt.
&#8220;Surely that was the bitterest irony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if it was,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;No, I
am sure it wasn&#8217;t. He wanted to leave the children
thinking as well as possible of their victim,
and especially of Mr. Bonner; and there
was really something in Mr. Carmichael&#8217;s talk
which could be praised. I have known Jim Irwin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
since we were both children, and I feel
sure that if he had had any idea that his treatment
of this man had been unnecessarily cruel,
it would have given him a lot of pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Brathwayt, &#8220;I think
you are to be congratulated for having known
for a long time a genius.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jennie. And Mrs. Brathwayt
gave her a glance which brought to her
cheek another blush; but of a different sort
from the one provoked by the uproar in the
Woodruff school.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt now that Jim was
thoroughly wonderful&mdash;nor that she, the county
superintendent, was quite as thoroughly a little
fool. She to be put in authority over him!
It was too absurd for laughter. Fortunately,
she hadn&#8217;t hindered him much&mdash;but who was
to be thanked for that? Was it owing to any
wisdom of hers? Well, she had decided in his
favor, in those first proceedings to revoke his
certificate. Perhaps that was as good a thing
to remember as was to be found in the record.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>AND SO THEY LIVED&mdash;&mdash;</h3>
</div>

<p>And so it turned out quite as if it were in
the old ballad, that &#8220;all in the merry
month of May,&#8221; and also &#8220;all in the merry green
wood,&#8221; there were great doings about the bold
little promontory where once stood the cabin
on the old wood-lot where the Simms family
had dwelt. The brook ran about the promontory,
and laid at its feet on three sides a carpet
of blue-grass, amid clumps of trees and
wild bushes. Not far afield on either hand
came the black corn-land, but up and down the
bluffy sides of the brook for some distance on
both sides of the King-dragged highway, ran
the old wood-lot, now regaining much of the
unkempt appearance which characterized it
when Jim Irwin had drawn upon himself the
gentle rebuke of Old Man Simms for not giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
a whoop from the big road before coming
into the yard.</p>
<p>But Old Man Simms was gone, with all the
Simmses, now thoroughly established on the
Blanchard farm, and quite happy in their new
success. The cabin was gone, and in its place
stood a pretty little bungalow, about which
blossomed the lilacs and peonies and roses and
other old-fashioned flowers, planted there long
ago by some pioneer woman, nourished back to
thriftiness by old Mrs. Simms, and carefully
preserved during the struggles with the builders
of the bungalow by Mrs. Irwin. For this
was Mrs. Irwin&#8217;s new home. It was, in point
of fact, the teacher&#8217;s house or schoolmanse for
the new consolidated Woodruff District, and
the old Simms wood-lot was the glebe-land of
the schoolmanse.</p>
<p>Jim turned over and over in his mind these
new applications of old, historic, significant
words, dear to every reader of history&mdash;&#8220;glebe-land,&#8221;
&#8220;schoolmanse&#8221;&mdash;and it seemed to him
that they signified the return of many old
things lost in Merrie England, lost in New England,
lost all over the English-speaking world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
when the old publicly-paid clergyman ceased
to be so far the servant of all the people that
they refused to be taxed for his support. Was
not the new kind of rural teacher to be a publicly-paid
leader of thought, of culture, of progress,
and was he not to have his manse, his
glebe-land, and his &#8220;living&#8221;? And all because,
like the old clergymen, he was doing a work
in which everybody was interested and for
which they were willing to be taxed. Perhaps
it was not so high a status as the old; but who
was to say that? Certainly not Jim Irwin, the
possessor of the new kind of &#8220;living,&#8221; with its
&#8220;glebe-land&#8221; and its &#8220;schoolmanse.&#8221; He would
have rated the new quite as high as the old.</p>
<p>From the brow of the promontory, a light
concrete bridge took the pretty little gorge in
the leap of a single arch, and landed the eye
at the bottom of the front yard of the schoolhouse.
Thus the new institution of life was
in full view of the schoolmanse veranda, and
yet shut off from it by the dry moat of the
brook and its tiny meadow of blue-grass.</p>
<p>Across the road was the creamery, with its
businesslike unloading platform, and its addition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
in process of construction for the reception
of the machinery for the cooperative
laundry. Not far from the creamery, and also
across the road, stood the blacksmith and
wheelwright shop. Still farther down the
stream were the barn, poultry house, pens,
hutches and yards of the little farm&mdash;small,
economically made, and unpretentious, as were
all the buildings save the schoolhouse itself,
which was builded for the future.</p>
<p>And even the schoolhouse, when one thinks
of the uses to which it was to be put&mdash;kitchen,
nursery, kindergarten, banquet-hall, theater,
moving-picture hall, classrooms, manual training
rooms, laboratory and counting-room and
what-not, was wonderfully small&mdash;Colonel
Woodruff said far too small&mdash;though it was
necessarily so large as to be rather astonishing
to the unexpectant passer-by.</p>
<p>The unexpectant passer-by this May day,
however, would have been especially struck by
the number of motor-cars, buggies and surreys
parked in the yard back of the creamery, along
the roadside, and by the driveway running to
the schoolhouse. People in numbers had arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
by five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and were
still coming. They strolled about the place,
examining the buildings and grounds, and talking
with the blacksmith and the butter-maker,
gradually drawing into the schoolhouse like a
swarm of bees into a hive selected by the
queen. None of them, however, went across
the concrete bridge to the schoolmanse, save
Mrs. Simms, who crossed, consulted with Mrs.
Irwin about the shrubbery and flowers, and
went back to Buddie and Jinnie, who were good
children but natchally couldn&#8217;t be trusted with
so many other young ones withouten some
watchin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming! They&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the cry borne to the people in and
about the schoolhouse by that Hans Hansen
who would be called Hans Nilsen. Hans had
been to the top of the little hill and had a look
toward town. Like a crew manning the rigging,
or a crowd having its picture taken, the
assemblage crystallized into forms determined
by the chances of getting a glimpse of the bungalow
across the ravine&mdash;on posts, fences,
trees and hillocks. Still nobody went across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
the bridge, and when McGeehee Simms and
Johnny Bonner strayed to the bridge-head,
Mrs. Simms called them back by a minatory,
&#8220;Buddy, what did I <i>tell</i> you? You come hyah!&#8221;</p>
<p>A motor-car came over the hillock, ran down
the road to the driveway to the schoolmanse
and drew up at the door. Out of it stepped
Mrs. Woodruff and the colonel, their daughter,
the county superintendent of schools, and Mr.
Jim Irwin. Jennie was dressed in a very well-tailored
traveling costume, and Jim in a moderately
well-tailored business suit. Mrs. Irwin
kissed her son and Jennie, and led the way into
the house. Jennie and Jim followed&mdash;and
when they went in, the crowd over across the
ravine burst forth into a tremendous cheer,
followed by a three-times-three and a tiger.
The unexpectant passer-by would have been
rather surprised at this, but we who are acquainted
with the parties must all begin to
have our suspicions. The fact that when they
reached the threshold Jim picked Jennie up in
his arms and carried her in, will enable any
good detective to put one and one together and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
make a pair&mdash;which comes pretty near telling
the whole story.</p>
<p>By this time it was nearly seven, and Calista
Simms came across the charmed bridge as a
despatch-bearer, saying that if Mr. Jim and
Miss Jennie didn&#8217;t mind, dinner would be
suhved right soon. It was cooked about right,
and the folks was gettin&#8217; right hungry&mdash;an&#8217;
such a crowd! There were fifteen in the
babies&#8217; room, and for a while they thought the
youngest Hamm young one had swallowed a
marble. She would tell &#8217;em they would be right
over; good-by.</p>
<p>There was another cheer as the three elderly
and the two young people emerged from the
schoolmanse and took their way over the
bridge to the school side of the velvet-bottomed
moat; but it did not terminate in three-times-three
and a tiger. It was, in fact shut off like
the vibration of a bell dipped in water by the
sudden rush of the shouters into the big assembly-room,
now filled with tables for the banquet&mdash;and
here the domestic economy classes,
with their mothers, sisters, female cousins and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
aunts, met them, as waiters, hat-snatchers,
hostesses, floor-managers and cooks, scoring
the greatest triumph of history in the Woodruff
District. For everything went off like
clockwork, especially the victuals&mdash;and such
victuals!</p>
<p>There was quantity in meats, breads, vegetables&mdash;and
there was also savor. There was
plenty, and there was style. Ask Mrs. Haakon
Peterson, who yearned for culture, and had
been afraid her children wouldn&#8217;t get it if Yim
Irwin taught them nothing but farming. She
will tell you that the dinner&mdash;which so many
thought of all the time as supper&mdash;was yust
as well served as it if had been in the Chamberlain
Hotel in Des Moines, where she had
stayed when she went with Haakon to the
state convention.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t it have been even better
served? It was planned, cooked, served and
eaten by people of intelligence and brains, in
their own house, as a community affair, and
in a community where, if any one should ask
you, you are authorized to state that there&#8217;s as
much wealth to the acre as in any strictly farming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
spot between the two oceans, and where
you are perfectly safe&mdash;financially&mdash;in dropping
from a balloon in the dark of the moon,
and paying a hundred and fifty dollars an acre
for any farm you happen to land on. Why
shouldn&#8217;t things have been well done, when
every one worked, not for money, but for the
love of the doing, and the love of learning to
do in the best way?</p>
<p>Some of these things came out in the
speeches following the repast&mdash;and some other
things, too. It was probably not quite fair for
B. B. Hamm to incorporate in his wishes for
the welfare and prosperity and so forth of Jim
and Jennie that stale one about the troubles
of life, but he wanted to see Jennie blush&mdash;which
as a matter of fact he did; but she
failed to grow quite so fiery red as did Jim.
But B. B. was a good fellow, and a Trojan in
his work for the cause, and the schoolmaster
and superintendent of schools forgave him. A
remark may be a little broad, and still clean,
and B. B. made a clean speech mainly devoted
to the increased value of that farm he at one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
memorable time was going to sell before Jim&#8217;s
fool notions could be carried out.</p>
<p>Colonel Woodruff made most of the above
points which I have niched from him. He had
begun as a reformer late in life, he said, but
he would leave it to them if he hadn&#8217;t worked
at the trade steadily after enlistment. He had
become a follower of Jim Irwin, because Jim&#8217;s
reform was like dragging the road in front of
your own farm&mdash;it was reform right at home,
and not at the county seat, or Des Moines, or
Washington. He had followed Jim Irwin as he
had followed Lincoln, and Grant, and Blaine,
and McKinley&mdash;because Jim Irwin stood for
more upward growth for the average American
citizen than the colonel could see any prospect
of getting from any other choice. And
he was proud to live in a country like this,
saved and promoted by the great men he had
followed, and in a neighborhood served and
promoted, if not quite saved, by Jim Irwin.
And he was not so sure about its not being
saved. Every man and nation had to be saved
anew every so often, and the colonel believed
that Jim Irwin&#8217;s new kind of rural school is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
just as necessary to the salvation of this country
as Lincoln&#8217;s new kind of recognition of
human rights was half a century ago. &#8220;I am
about to close my speech,&#8221; said the colonel,
&#8220;and the small service I have been able to give
to this nation. I went through the war, neighbors&mdash;and
am proud of it; but I&#8217;ve done more
good in the peaceful service of the last three
years than I did in four of fighting and campaigning.
That&#8217;s the way I feel about what
we&#8217;ve done in Consolidated District Number
One.&#8221; (Vociferous and long-continued applause.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel!&#8221; The voice of Angie Talcott
rose from away back near the kitchen. &#8220;Can
Jennie keep on bein&#8217; county superintendent,
now she&#8217;s married?&#8221;</p>
<p>A great guffaw of laughter reduced poor
Angie to tears; and Jennie had to go over and
comfort her. It was all right for her to ask
that, and they ought not to laugh at Angie, so
there! Now, you&#8217;re all right, and let&#8217;s talk
about the new schoolhouse, and so forth. Jennie
brought the smiles back to Angle&#8217;s face,
just in time to hear Jim tell the people amid
louder cheers that he had been asked to go into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the rural-school extension work in two states,
and had been offered a fine salary in either
place, but that he wasn&#8217;t even considering these
offers. And about that time, the children began
to get sleepy and cross and naughty, and
the women set in motion the agencies which
moved the crowd homeward.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Before a bright wood fire&mdash;which they really
didn&#8217;t need, but how else was Jim&#8217;s mother to
show off the little fireplace?&mdash;sat Jim and Jennie.
They had been together for a week now&mdash;this
being their home-coming&mdash;and had only
begun to get really happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine to have the fireplace?&#8221; said
Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we can&#8217;t really afford to burn a fire
in it&mdash;in Iowa,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Fuel&#8217;s too everlastingly
scarce. If we use it much, the fagots
and deadwood on our &#8216;glebe-land&#8217; won&#8217;t last
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you should take that Oklahoma position,&#8221;
said Jennie, &#8220;we could afford to have open wood
fires all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s warmer in Oklahoma,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
wood&#8217;s more plentiful. Yes&#8221;&mdash;contemplatively&mdash;&#8220;we
could, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be nice, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim briskly, &#8220;get me my
writing materials, and we&#8217;ll accept. It&#8217;s still
open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie sat looking into the fire oblivious of
the suggestion. She was smiling. Jim moved
uneasily, and rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe I can better guess
where mother would put those writing materials
than you could, after all. I&#8217;ll hunt them
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he passed, Jennie took him by the hand
and pulled him down on the arm of her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t be mean to me! You
know you wouldn&#8217;t do such a wicked, wicked
thing at this time as to leave the people here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;whatever you say is
the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jennie spoke again things had taken
place which caused her voice to emanate from
Jim&#8217;s shirt-front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear,&#8221; said she, &#8220;what Angie Talcott
asked?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;h&#8217;m,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jennie, &#8220;now that I&#8217;m married
can I go on being county superintendent?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to?&#8221; asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of,&#8221; said Jennie; &#8220;if I knew enough
about things to do anything worth while; but
I&#8217;m afraid that by rising to my full height I
shall always just fail to be able to see over
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done more for the schools of the
county,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;in the last year than any
other county superintendent has ever done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we shall need the money so like&mdash;so
like the dickens,&#8221; said Jennie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not so badly,&#8221; laughed Jim, &#8220;except for
the first year. I&#8217;ll have this little farm paying
as much as some quarter-sections when we get
squared about. Why, we can make a living on
this school farm, Jennie,&mdash;or I&#8217;m not fit to be
the head of the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another silence, during which
Jennie took down her hair, and wound it
around Jim&#8217;s neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will settle itself soon one of these days
anyhow,&#8221; said he at last. &#8220;There&#8217;s enough to
do for both of us right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they won&#8217;t pay me,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t pay the ministers&#8217; wives,&#8221; said
Jim, &#8220;and yet, the ministers with the right sort
of wives are always the best paid. I guess
you&#8217;ll be in the bill, Jennie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim walked to the open window and looked
out over the still landscape. The untidy grounds
appealed to him&mdash;there would be lessons in
their improvement for both the children and
the older people. It was all good. Down in
the little meadow grew the dreaming trees,
their round crowns rising as from a sea not
quite to the level of the bungalow, their thrifty
leaves glistening in the moonlight. Across
the pretty bridge lay the silent little campus
with its twentieth-century temple facing its
chief priest. It was all good, without and
within. He went across the hall to bid his
mother good night. She clung to him convulsively,
and they had their own five minutes
which arranged matters for these two silent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
natures on the new basis forever. Jennie was
in white before the mantel when he returned,
smiling at the inscription thereon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you put it in Latin?&#8221; she inquired.
&#8220;It would have had so much more distinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted it to have meaning instead,&#8221; said
Jim. &#8220;And besides, nobody who was at hand
was quite sure how to turn the Latin phrase.
Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennie leaned forward with her elbows on
her knees, and studied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I could,&#8221; said she, &#8220;without any
pony. But after all, I like it better as it is.
I like everything, Jim&mdash;everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;LET US CEASE THINKING SO MUCH
OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, AND
DEVOTE OURSELVES TO EDUCATIONAL
AGRICULTURE. SO WILL THE NATION
BE MADE STRONG.&#8221;</p>
